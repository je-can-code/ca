 * [v1.0 LBS] Enables "learning by state"- another way to learn skills.
 * @author JE
 * @help
 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin allows the ability for states to potentially teach the actor
 * afflicted new skills if they levelup while afflicted with them.
 * 
 * In order to utilize this functionality, add a tag in the "notes" section of
 * a state that matches the following structure below:
 * 
 * <learnByStateChance:SKILL_ID:PERCENT_CHANCE>
 * Where SKILL_ID is the id of the skill to learn
 * Where PERCENT_CHANCE is the percent to learn the skill on-levelup.
 * 
 * An example of this looks like:
 * <learnByStateChance:99:5>
 * 
 * Which translates to:
 * learn skill with id of 99 (from database)
 * with a 5% (5/100) chance upon levelup.
 * 
 * The tag isn't case sensitive, but it is whitespace sensitive, 
 * so I'd recommend keeping it basically without any spaces in the tag.
 * ============================================================================
