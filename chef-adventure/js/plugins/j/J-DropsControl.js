 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin rewrites the way gold and item drops from enemies are handled.
 * ============================================================================
 * NEW
 *  FEATURES:
 *  - PERCENTAGE DROPS
 *
 *  TAGS:
 *  - ADDITIONAL ITEMS
 *  - DROP MULTIPLIER
 *  - GOLD MULTIPLIER
 * ============================================================================
 * WARNING 1:
 * This is likely incompatible with any other plugins that interact with the
 * drops for enemies unless it was specifically written as an extension of
 * this plugin.
 *
 * WARNING 2:
 * The party ability of "Drop Item Double" will double the entire multiplier
 * that is provided via the tags. Having multiple of this party ability will
 * not further double the multiplier.
 * ============================================================================
 * PERCENTAGE DROPS:
 * Have you ever wanted an enemy to drop something say... 40% of the time, but
 * realized you can't put decimal numbers into the enemy drop "denominator"
 * field in the editor, or go dig up your probability section out of your math
 * book to remember the formula to translate a percentage into a probability?
 *
 * Well look no further because now you can just enter a number into the drop
 * items "Probability" box and that number will be treated as a #/100 chance!
 * For example, if you enter "40" in the "Probability" field on the Enemy tab
 * in the database, it will be treated as "a 40/100 chance of acquiring the
 * loot, aka 40% chance".
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT USING THIS PLUGIN:
 * By having this plugin enabled, you opt into the PERCENTAGE DROPS feature
 * and cannot disable it. It is required, and probably the reason you're using
 * this plugin anyway.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT TREASURE HUNTER GODLINESS:
 * If the percentage chance exceeds 100%, the drop item will always drop.
 * This sounds obvious, but remember this when looking at the TAG EXAMPLES.
 * ============================================================================
 * ADDITIONAL ITEMS:
 * Have you ever wanted to drop more items than just three per enemy? Well now
 * you can with the proper tags applied to enemies in the database!
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT NATIVE DROP INTERACTIONS:
 * This is additive in the sense that if you specify drop items using the
 * editor and also have one or more of these tags on an enemy, it will add
 * all of them together as potential drops, exceeding the limit of 3.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT DUPLICATE TAGS:
 * You can have more than one of the same item drop, at the same or different
 * rates and they will individually be processed.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Enemies only.
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 * <drops:[TYPE,ID,CHANCE]>
 * where TYPE is either "i", "w", or "a" (representing item/weapon/armor).
 * where ID is the id of the drop item in the database.
 * where CHANCE is the percent chance to drop.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <drops:[i,3,10]>
 * This enemy has a [10% chance] to drop [an item] of [id 3 in the database].
 *
 *  <drops:[w,12,65]>
 *  <drops:[w,12,15]>
 *  <drops:[a,5,100]>
 * This enemy has a [65% chance] to drop [a weapon] of [id 12 in the database].
 * This enemy has a [15% chance] to drop [a weapon] of [id 12 in the database].
 * This enemy has a [100% chance] to drop [an armor] of [id 5 in the database].
 * ============================================================================
 * DROP MULTIPLIER
 * Additionally, you can apply tags to increase this percentage chance
 * multiplicatively! See the tag examples down below for additional details
 * on how the multiplication works and the caveats to consider when adding
 * the tag to things in the database.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The bonuses from all members in the battle party will be considered by
 * adding them all together to produce a "party drop item rate".
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <dropMultiplier:NUM>
 * Where NUM is the a positive amount to increase drop item rate.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <dropMultiplier:50>
 * This actor now has +50% drop chance.
 * - If a drop item on an enemy has a 40% chance to drop, with this drop
 * multiplier bonus it would be increased from 40% >> 60% (50% of 40 is 20)
 * - If a drop item on an enemy has a 4% chance to drop, with this drop
 * multiplier bonus, it would be increased from 4% >> 6% (50% of 4 is 2)
 *
 *  <dropMultiplier:10>
 *  <dropMultiplier:40>
 *  <dropMultiplier:200>
 * This actor now has +250% drop chance.
 * - If a drop item on an enemy has a 40% chance to drop, with this drop
 * multiplier bonus, it would be increased from 40% >> 140% (250% of 40 is 100)
 * - If a drop item on an enemy has a 4% chance to drop, with this drop
 * multiplier bonus, it would be increased from 4% >> 14% (250% of 4 is 10)
 * ============================================================================
 * GOLD MULTIPLIER
 * Have you ever wanted to have an actor gain bonus gold for some thiefy
 * reason or another? Well now you can by applying the proper tags to the
 * various database locations that are relevant.
 *
 * NOTE 1:
 * This does not apply to gold earned from other sources,
 * such as event/script/plugin commands.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 * The bonuses from all members in the battle party will be considered by
 * adding them all together to produce a "party gold rate".
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <goldMultiplier:NUM>
 * Where NUM is the a positive amount to increase gold earned rate.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <goldMultiplier:50>
 * The party will now gain +50% gold from defeated enemies.
 *
 *  <goldMultiplier:65>
 *  <goldMultiplier:10>
 *  <goldMultiplier:100>
 * The party will now gain +175% gold from defeated enemies.
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG:
 * - 2.0.0
 *    Retroactively added this CHANGELOG.
 *    Refactored various data retrieval methods from given battlers.
 *    Fixed issue with mismapped level calculations.
 *    Added more jsdocs and comments to explain better the logical flow.
 *    Removed useless methods.
 * - 1.0.0
 *    The initial release.
 * ============================================================================
