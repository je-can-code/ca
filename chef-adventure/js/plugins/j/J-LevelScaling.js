 * [v1.0 LEVEL] Scales damage and exp/gold rewards from defeated enemies.
 * @author JE

 * @base J-BASE
 * @orderAfter J-BASE
 * @help
 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin scales damage dealt and received in combat by a factor based on
 * the difference in level between the two battlers.
 * 
 * All that is needed is to add a tag to enemy battlers to define their level:
 * <level:NUM>
 * Where NUM is the level you want this particular enemy to be.
 * 
 * The level scale is +/- 10 levels, where if the difference is +10 levels
 * between one battler and another, then damage dealt will be multiplied by 2,
 * and damage received from a target -10 levels from the opposing battler will
 * be reduced to 10%. As a reward for managing to defeat higher-level battlers,
 * you will receive bonus experience/gold from them at the same multiplicative
 * rate as the damage is dealt. On the flipside, if you're significantly more
 * powerful than the opposing battler, defeating it will net a reduced reward.
 * 
 * If you do not want a particular enemy to benefit/detriment from this effect,
 * leave off the tag of <level:NUM> and the multiplier will not be used.
 * 
 * If you need to toggle this plugin, you can use the plugin commands to
 * enable/disable it on-the-fly.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The point of this plugin was to help mitigate a player staying in a single
 * area for excessive amounts of time farming weaker enemies to level up.
 * 
 * The scaling does go both ways, which can also help buffer the need to
 * constantly tweak and adjust numbers (or worsen the need) for allies and
 * enemies parameters.
