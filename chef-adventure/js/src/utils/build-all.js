/**
 * BUILDER
 *
 * OVERVIEW:
 * This nodejs script is intended to be used to quickly execute ALL "once:" types
 * of builds present in ../ directory's package.json. This is designed to run them
 * in parallel
 *
 * NOTE:
 * This takes advantage of import assertions to get the package.json. You may need
 * to ensure you have the latest nodejs installed to run it.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * There are no additional arguments required, just use node to run it.
 *
 * SAMPLE INPUT:
 * $ node build-all.js
 *
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 *
 * // imagine this is all your various build logs being output here.
 *
 * ðŸ‘Š Builderâ„¢ has completed execution. ðŸ’¯âœ…
