 * [v1.0.0 TIME] A system for tracking time- real or artificial.

 * @help
 * ==============================================================================
 * This is a system that tracks time, either artificial or real, and manipulates
 * various components of the game based on the time.
 *
 * 	Temporally Integrated Monitoring of Ecosystems- aka TIME.
 *
 * ==============================================================================
 * This plugin enables a TIME system. The TIME system functions much like you'd
 * expect: it tracks TIME. This TIME however, is configurable in many ways that
 * regular time is not.
 *
 * There are two forms of time-keeping, real and artificial.
 *
 * REAL TIME
 * Real time acts much like you'd expect: it reads the client's computer's time
 * and updates every half of a second to keep in sync with real time. All of
 * the features surrounding this TIME system (relating to time of day or seasons)
 * operate the same as artificial, but based on real time.
 *
 * ARTIFICIAL TIME
 * Artificial time acts similar to real time, but instead of reading the time
 * from your computer, it starts at a designated point that you specify and ticks
 * ever forward. The rate at which time ticks forward defaults to 60 frames per
 * second, but you can reduce that if you want time to pass faster. Alternatively
 * (or in addition to), you can also adjust the amount of time that passes per
 * "tock". A "tock" is defined as "on-increment", so for example, when the second
 * counter increments past 59 to 60, you would expect the minutes to go up by 1.
 * That incrementing is a "tock", that is defined by you. You can define how much
 * that increment is for each unit of time: seconds, minutes, hours, days,
 * months, and years. I would encourage this be explored before tweaking the
 * defaults.
 *
 * VARIABLES
 * Unless disabled, both real and artificial TIME will track the various
 * components of the current TIME in variables, to allow for developing events
 * revolving around TIME. You can specify in the plugin parameters which variables
 * you want these to be assigned to. If you do not want one or more of the TIME
 * components tracked in variable, but do want to leverage the functionality of
 * variable assignment, then just assign the TIME components that you do not care
 * about to variable id of 0.
 *
 * TIME OF DAY
 * Additionally, this system tracks "time of day". "Time of Day" is defined as
 * a block of time (measured in hours) that is named.
 * There are six of these blocks of time that make up a day:
 * - Night (00:00am - 03:59am)
 * - Dawn (04:00am - 7:59am)
 * - Morning (08:00am - 11:59am)
 * - Afternoon (12:00pm - 15:59pm)
 * - Evening (16:00pm - 19:59pm)
 * - Twilight (20:00pm - 23:59pm)
 *
 * Alongside the "time of day" functionality, there is also an optional "tone"
 * adjustment to alter the screen tone based on "time of day". The tone will
 * change on the hour. This can be disabled entirely, or selectively with tags.
 * Keep in mind that, understandably, this does not play nicely with manual
 * tone-changes from outside this system. If you intend to control the tone
 * yourself, you should probably disable the tone-change functionality for
 * those maps.
 *
 * SEASON OF YEAR
 * Additionally, this system tracks the "season of the year". The "season of
 * the year" is defined likely much how you think it is: a block of time
 * (measured in months) that is named.
 * - Spring (march, april, may)
 * - Summer (june, july, august)
 * - Autumn (september, october, november)
 * - Winter (december, january, february)
 * Nothing special happens as months progress, you as the developer can decide
 * what to do when it is the summer months or the winter months if you want.
 *
 * TAGS
 * If you want the auto-tone changing, but want it disabled for certain maps,
 * then you can use this note tag which will cause the system to not change the
 * tone when transfering to that particular map:
 * <noToneChange>
 *
 * If you are using artificial TIME, and you need TIME to be stopped for some
 * reason or another, you can use this tag on a map and while on that map, TIME
 * will be considered "blocked", where TIME will not flow:
 * <timeBlock>
 *
 * COMMANDS
 * There are a number of plugin commands available to manipulate TIME:
 * - Jump to time of day
 *   Jumping to a specific time of day may result in skipping a day. This will
 *   fast-forward to a particular time of day. If that time of day has already
 *   passed (or it is currently that time of day), the system will proceed to
 *   the next day's time of day. (common use case is sleeping at an inn till
 *   morning)
 *
 * - Set Time
 *   This sets the time to a fixed point in time. This is not relative. You will
 *   likely need to be cautious when using this particular command.
 *
 * - Fast Forward Time
 *   This fast-forwards time by a given amount.
 *
 * - Rewind Time
 *   This rewinds time by a given amount.
 *
 * - Show TIME on Map
 *   This toggles the TIME window to be visible on the map.
 *
 * - Hide TIME on Map
 *   This toggles the TIME window to be invisible on the map.
 *   NOTE: TIME will still pass while the window is hidden.
 *
 * - Stop TIME
 *   This halts the flow of TIME.
 *   NOTE: This is not compatible with "real" time. If you use this command with
 *   real time, it will pause the counting for the duration and pick back up
 *   with the current time when TIME is unblocked.
 *
 * - Start TIME
 *   This re-enables the flow of TIME.
 *   NOTE: This is not compatible with "real" time. If you used the stop command
 *   to halt real time, when re-enabled, it will pick up wherever it is currently
 *   which may result in skipping time.
 *
 * - Unlock Screen Tone
 *   This (re-)allows the TIME system to control screen tone.
 *   NOTE: This does nothing if the plugin parameters are set to disable screen
 *   tone changing entirely.
 *
 * - Lock Screen Tone
 *   This locks the TIME system from controlling the screen tone.
