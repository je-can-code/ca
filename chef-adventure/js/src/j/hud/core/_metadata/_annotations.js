 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin is the core of the J-HUD system.
 * By itself, it doesn't actually do anything, it is simply the manager that
 * all extensions of the HUD leverage to communicate their displayed data to
 * the user.
 *
 * In other words, the $hudManager object is created and saved here.
