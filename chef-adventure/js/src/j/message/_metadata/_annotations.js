 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin extends the variety of text codes available in windows.
 *
 * The message window is the main area most would benefit from, but if you are
 * a plugin developer, these can also be used anywhere that leverages the
 * "Window_Base.drawTextEx()" function.
 * ============================================================================
 * NEW TEXT CODES:
 * Have you ever wanted to be able to reference a particular entry in the
 * database without having to hardcode the name of the entry and the icon into
 * the message window? Well now you can! By adding the correct text codes into
 * your message windows (or in your plugins using .drawTextEx()), you too can
 * leverage entries from the database without any significant difficulty!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * All new text codes except \Enemy[ID] will also prepend their corresponding
 * icon as well. This is because enemies don't have icons assigned to them.
 *
 * NEW TEXT CODES AVAILABLE:
 *  From their own respectively named tabs
 *  \Weapon[ID]
 *  \Armor[ID]
 *  \Item[ID]
 *  \State[ID]
 *  \Skill[ID]
 *  \Enemy[ID]
 *
 *  From the "Types" tab:
 *  \element[ID]
 *  \equipType[ID]
 *  \weaponType[ID]
 *  \armorType[ID]
 *  \skillType[ID]
 *
 *  From other plugins:
 *  \sdp[SDP_KEY]
 *
 * Where ID is the id of the entry in the database.
 * Where SDP_KEY is the key of the panel.
 *
 * NEW TEXT CODES EXAMPLES:
 *  \Weapon[4]
 * The text of "\Weapon[4]" will be replaced with:
 * - the icon of the weapon matching id 4 in the database.
 * - the name of the weapon matching id 4 in the database.
 *
 *  \Skill[101]
 * The text of "\Skill[101]" will be replaced with:
 * - the icon of the skill matching id 101 in the database.
 * - the name of the skill matching id 101 in the database.
 * ============================================================================
 * NEW TEXT STYLES:
 * Have you ever wanted to be able to style your already amazing comic sans ms
 * font with italics or bold? Well now you can! By adding the correct text
 * codes into your message windows (or in your plugins using .drawTextEx()),
 * you too can flourish with italics and/or stand stoic with bold!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The following styles act as 'toggles', in the sense that all characters that
 * are surrounded by the text codes of \_ or \* would be of their corresponding
 * style- italics or bold respectively. See the examples for clarity.
 *
 * NEW TEXT STYLES AVAILABLE:
 *  \_      (italics)
 *  \*      (bold)
 *
 * NEW TEXT STYLES EXAMPLES:
 *  "so it is \*gilbert\*. We finally meet \_at last\_."
 * In the passage above, the word "gilbert" would be bolded.
 * In the passage above, the words "at least" would be italicized.
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG:
 * - 1.1.0
 *    Implemented element, the four "types" from database data.
 *    Added plugin dependency of J-Base.
 *    Implemented SDP panel text code format.
 * - 1.0.0
 *    Initial release.
 *    Implemented style toggles for bold and italics.
 *    Implemented weapon/armor/item/state/skill/enemy names from database data.
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG:
 * - 1.1.0
 *    Added additional ways to modify text.
 * - 1.0.0
 *    The initial release.
