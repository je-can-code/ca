 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin extends the functionality of skills. It features additional
 * functionality that allow you to leverage new strategies in skill learning
 * and game development.
 *
 * DETAILS:
 * The new functionalities available are as follows:
 * - Skills extending skills.
 * - On-hit self-state application.
 * - On-cast self-state application.
 * ============================================================================
 * SKILL EXTENSION:
 * Have you ever wanted to have a single skill gain additional effects by
 * learning other skills? Well now you can! By applying the appropriate tag to
 * the skill(s) in question, you too can have skills that can progressively
 * gain additional upgrades/capabilities as a battler learns more skills!
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Skills only.
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <skillExtend:[NUM]>
 *  <skillExtend:[NUM,NUM,...]>
 * Where NUM is the skill id to extend.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <skillExtend:[40]>
 * This skill will act as an extension to skill of id 40.
 *
 *  <skillExtend:[7,8,9,10,11]>
 * This skill will act as an extension to all skills of id 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT DOES "ACT AS AN EXTENSION" MEAN?
 * ============================================================================
 * This section of information is so important that it gets its own headline!
 *
 * Lets pretend that in our fictional example, skill id 40 maps to "Fireball".
 * We want to extend our "Fireball" skill in some way by using this skill's
 * data points. What might that look like? It can manifest in a variety of
 * ways, but with this plugin, we use extension skills as OVERRIDES or AUGMENTS
 * to the base skill. Thusly, if this skill were some kind of upgrade, you
 * could fill in the damage formula to maybe have higher multipliers, and
 * add some extra repeats (offset of +1). The changes in the skill will overlay
 * the base skill's parameters and apply BEFORE the skill's execution. You
 * can see below for a comprehensive list of what happens to the base skill
 * based on an extension skill.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Effects are only added or updated. Tags cannot be removed by this plugin
 * with the single exception of the extend tag.
 *
 * Comprehensive breakdown of how things are overridden:
 *  If a damage type is checked:
 *    - yes/no critical option is replaced.
 *    - base element id is replaced.
 *    - allowed upgrade of "hp damage" >> "hp drain" (but not cross or reverse)
 *    - allowed upgrade of "mp damage" >> "mp drain" (but not cross or reverse)
 *    - damage variance is replaced.
 *    - the formula itself is replaced if it is not completely empty.
 *  Other sections include:
 *    - the "effects" section of the skill just adds right into the base skill.
 *    - the two "meta" objects are merged with the extension skill's priority.
 *    - the extension skill's "note" object is appended onto the base skill's.
 *    - the repeats are added onto the base (offset of +1).
 *    - the speed is added onto the base.
 *    - the success is added onto the base (only if not same or equal to 100).
 *    - the scope is replaced.
 *    - the mp cost is replaced.
 *    - the tp cost is replaced.
 *    - the tp gain is added onto the base.
 *    - if the hit type section is not "certain hit", then it replaces.
 *    - both message lines are replaced.
 *  Base data things of note:
 *    - the "occasion" is not changeable.
 *    - though "note" objects are appended, the tag for extension is removed
 *      to prevent recursive behaviors in skill extension. This removal is
 *      only for this execution of the skill for overlay purposes only.
 *    - the editor's speed cap of +/-2000 is not respected!
 *    - the editor's success cap of 0-100 is not respected!
 *  If using JABS, the following data points are added if missing or if
 * they already exist on the base skill, their values are updated:
 *  - moveType (???)
 *  - projectile
 *  - counterGuard (***)
 *  - counterParry (***)
 *  - parry (***)
 *  - guard (***)
 *  - bonusHits
 *  - aggroMultiplier
 *  - bonusAggro
 *  - combo (!!!)
 *  - castTime
 *  - castAnimation
 *  - poseSuffix
 *  - knockback
 *  - piercing
 *  - shape
 *  - duration
 *  - actionId (!!!)
 *  - proximity
 *  - range
 *  - cooldown
 * If using JABs, the following datapoints will simply continue to exist
 * because they are idempotent traits:
 *  - uniqueCooldown
 *  - direct (!!!)
 *  - freeCombo
 *
 * ???:
 *  The effects of adding the "moveType" tag onto a skill that didn't
 *  previously have it are completely untested, use at your own risk!
 * ***:
 *  The effects of adding the "counterGuard/counterParry" tags onto a skill
 *  that didn't previously have it are untested, though shouldn't cause any
 *  problems if they are added onto a skill with "guard & parry".
 * !!!:
 *  The effects of adding the "combo/actionId/direct" tags onto any skills is
 *  something to be careful about, as they very significantly change how
 *  the manager interacts with the actions. Replacing any of those values
 *  though should be totally fine if they already existed on the base skill.
 *
 * With that in mind, it is strongly recommended that you copy-paste the base
 * skill into the extension skill slot in your RMMZ editor database skill tab
 * to start your extension (or another skill extension of the same skill
 * perhaps)!
 * ============================================================================
 * SELF-STATE APPLICATION:
 * Have you ever wanted a battler to be able to inflict themselves with a state
 * upon execution of a skill? Well now you can! By applying the appropriate tag
 * to the skill(s) in question, you too can have battlers that are applying
 * states of any kind to themselves!
 *
 * NOTE 1:
 * State resistance is not taken into account in regards to the CHANCE of the
 * various self-state effects. It is assumed that the percent chance designated
 * in the tag is fully representative of the chance that the state will be
 * applied to the caster.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 * In addition to JABS multiple projectiles triggering the on-hit effect
 * multiple times, having a skill "repeat", or in JABS have multiple hits on
 * the skill, will both result in triggering the on-hit effect multiple times.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Skills only.
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <onCastSelfState:[STATE_ID,CHANCE]>
 *  <onHitSelfState:[STATE_ID,CHANCE]>
 * Where STATE_ID is the id of the state to apply.
 * Where CHANCE is the percent chance between 0 and 100 that it'll apply.
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <onCastSelfState:[3,40]>
 * The caster has a 40% chance of applying state w/ id of 3 to oneself.
 * When using JABS, this applies as soon as the skill/action is executed.
 * When using non-JABS, this applies in the same phase as you would gain TP
 * from executing a skill.
 *
 *  <onHitSelfState:[19,100]>
 * The caster has a 100% (always) chance of appling state id 19 to oneself.
 * This processes as soon as the skill is "applied" to the target.
 * When using JABS, this applies as soon as the skill/action connects with
 * a target of any kind. This will trigger multiple times if an action has
 * multiple projectiles.
 * When using non-JABS, this applies when a skill is being executed against a
 * target. This happens regardless the outcome of the skill.
