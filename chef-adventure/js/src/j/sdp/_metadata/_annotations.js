 * [v1.2.0 SDP] Enables the SDP system, aka Stat Distribution Panels.

 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin is a form of "stat distribution"- an alternative to the standard
 * of leveling up to raise an actor's stats.
 *
 * Integrates with others of mine plugins:
 * - J-ControlledDrops; enables usage of item-as-panel drops.
 * - J-CriticalFactors; enables usage of CDM/CDR as parameters on panels.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DETAILS:
 * This system allows the player's party to unlock "stat distribution panels"
 * (aka SDPs), by means of plugin command.
 *
 * The scene to manage unlocked SDPs is accessible via the menu, the JABS
 * quick menu, or via plugin command.
 *
 * Each SDP has the following:
 * - 1+ parameters (of the 27 available in RMMZ) with flat/percent growth.
 * - A fixed rank max.
 * - A relatively customizable formula to determine cost to rank up.
 * - Customizable name/icon/description1/description2.
 * - Rank up rewards for any/every/max rank, which can be most anything.
 *
 * In order to rank up these SDPs, you'll need to use SDP points. These can be
 * acquired by using the tags below, or by using plugin commands.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - SDP points gained from enemies are earned for all members of the party.
 * - SDP points are stored and spent on a per-actor basis.
 * - SDP points for an actor cannot be reduced below 0.
 * - Stat Distribution Panels are unlocked for all members of the party.
 * - Stat Distribution Panels being leveled or maxed can unlock other SDPs.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SDP POINTS:
 * Ever want enemies to drop SDP Points? Well now they can! By applying the
 * appropriate tag to the enemy/enemies in question, you can have enemies drop
 * as little or as much as you want them to.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Enemies only.
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <sdp:POINTS>
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <sdp:10>
 * The party will gain 10 SDP points from defeating this enemy.
 *
 *  <sdp:123456>
 * The party will gain 123456 SDP points from defeating this enemy.
 * ============================================================================
 * SDP MULTIPLIERS:
 * Ever want allies to gain some percentage amount more (or less) of the SDP
 * points earned from enemies? Well now you can! By applying the appropriate
 * tag to the various database locations applicable, you can gain a percentage
 * bonus/penalty amount of SDP points obtained!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * The format implies that you will be providing whole numbers and not actual
 * multipliers, like 1.3 or something. If multiple tags are present across the
 * various database locations on a single actor, they will stack additively.
 * SDP points cannot be reduced below 0 for an actor, but they most certainly
 * can receive negative amounts if the tags added up like that.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <sdpMultiplier:AMOUNT>    (for positive)
 *  <sdpMultiplier:-AMOUNT>   (for negative)
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <sdpMultiplier:25>
 * An actor with something equipped/applied that has the above tag will now
 * gain 25% increased SDP points.
 *
 *  <sdpMultiplier:80>
 *  <sdpMultiplier:-30>
 * An actor with something equipped/applied that has both of the above tags
 * will now gain 50% increased SDP points (80 - 30 = 50).
 * ============================================================================
 * CHANGELOG:
 * - 1.2.1
 *    Update to add tracking for total gained sdp points.
 *    Update to add tracking for total spent sdp points.
 * - 1.2.0
 *    Update to include Max TP as a valid panel parameter.
 * - 1.1.0
 *    Update to accommodate J-CriticalFactors.
 * - 1.0.0
 *    The initial release.
