 * @help
 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin enables the ability to have actors grow in prof when
 * using skills. Additionally, triggers can now be configured to execute
 * against these new proficiencies (and other things).
 * ============================================================================
 * PROFICIENCY BONUSES:
 * Have you ever wanted a battler to be able to gain some bonus proficiency by
 * means of something from the database? Well now you can! By applying the
 * appropriate tag to the various database locations, you too can have your
 * battlers gain bonus proficiency!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Bonuses are flat bonuses that get added to the base amount, not percentage.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - Enemies
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <proficiencyBonus:NUM>
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <proficiencyBonus:3>
 * The attacker now gains +3 bonus proficiency for any skill used.
 *
 *  <proficiencyBonus:50>
 * The attacker now gains +50 bonus proficiency for any skill used.
 * ============================================================================
 * PROFICIENCY BLOCKING:
 * Have you ever wanted a battler to NOT be able to gain proficiency? Well now
 * you can! By applying the appropriate tags to the various database locations,
 * you too can block any battler from giving or gaining proficiency!
 *
 * NOTE:
 * It is important to recognize that there are two tags that both block the
 * gain of proficiency in different ways. One tag is designed to prevent the
 * GIVING of proficiency, for most commonly being placed on enemies or states
 * that enemies can be placed in. The second tag is designed to prevent the
 * GAINING of proficiency, most commonly being placed on actors or states that
 * actors can be placed in... though either tag can go on anything as long as
 * you understand what you're doing.
 *
 * TAG USAGE:
 * - Actors
 * - Classes
 * - Skills
 * - Weapons
 * - Armors
 * - Enemies
 * - States
 *
 * TAG FORMAT:
 *  <proficiencyGivingBlock>
 * or
 *  <proficiencyGainingBlock>
 *
 * TAG EXAMPLES:
 *  <proficiencyGivingBlock>
 * The battler that has this tag will not GIVE proficiency to any opposing
 * battlers that hit this battler with skills.
 *
 *  <proficiencyGainingBlock>
 * The battler that has this tag will not be able to GAIN proficiency from any
 * battlers that this battler uses skills against.
 * ============================================================================
 * PLUGIN COMMANDS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COMMAND:
 * "Modify Actor's Proficiency"
 * This command will allow you to increase or decrease a single actor's
 * proficiency for a given skill. You only need choose the actor, skill, and
 * the amount to increase/decrease by.
 *
 * COMMAND:
 * "Modify Party's Proficiency"
 * This command will do the same as the single actor's command above, but
 * instead apply against the whole party.
