* ============================================================================
* This plugin enables the ability to add and view logs in a window while on
* the map. By itself, this plugin only creates the log window and gives access
* to a couple utilities to build logs and add them to the window.
*
* This plugin was designed for JABS, but doesn't require it.
* If added while using JABS, the log window will automatically register all
* actions taken, damage/healing dealth, and various other details that one
* might expect to find in this sort of window.
*
* Additionally, the log window is a command window under the covers, so it
* also supports scrolling via mouse or touch.
*
* Controller/keyboard support for the log window is not supported.
*
* This plugin has two dependencies that all must be present to work:
* - J-BASE (used for drawing the logs properly onto the window)
* - J-MessageTextCodes (used for translating text codes in logging)
* The MZ editor will inform you where this plugin needs to be relative to the
* other plugins (above/below/etc).
