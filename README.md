# 🧑‍🍳Chef Adventure (for MZ)

Welcome to the public repository for `Chef Adventure`, a personal RPG Maker MZ project of mine.

> 🚧**This documentation is a work in progress**🚧

## What is Chef Adventure?
`Chef Adventure` has been a pet project of mine for a long while across the different iterations of RPG Maker, with this
current version being built in **RPG Maker MZ**.

## Where did all the plugins and their documentation go?
In previous version of this project, the source of all my plugins were stored within this game project. That has since
changed, and now lives in another of mine repos:
> https://github.com/je-can-code/rmmz-plugins

If you want to grab the latest version of a plugin, I'd encourage visiting over there. From there, the `project/`
directory acts as a sample project that has all the compiled plugins available for grabbing, along with their usage
instructions. For example, here is the latest version of the `J-Base` plugin:
