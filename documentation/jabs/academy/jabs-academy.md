# `JABS Academy`
### Overview
There are a variety of things you'll probably find yourself doing for the first time and being confused. That is fine,
and why I created this academy! Due to the sheer breadth of things to cover, I've broken it down into a few
higher-level sections. 

- Initial setup and the required assets etc.
- Parameters in the context of `JABS`.
- Enemies and how to make them.
- Skills, their creation, assignment, and execution.
- States and all things negative or positive.

This is a work in progress.
