# `JABS Academy`
### Overview
There are a variety of things you'll probably find yourself doing for the first time and being confused. That is fine,
and why I created this academy! Due to the sheer breadth of things to cover, I've broken it down into a few
higher-level sections. 

- [Initial setup and the required assets etc.](jabs-initialization.md)
- [Parameters in the context of `JABS`.](jabs-parameters.md)
- Enemies and how to make them.
- Skills, their creation, assignment, and execution.
- States and all things negative or positive.

Additionally, there are some more complex topics and functional overwrites that took place when developing `JABS`. Those
will be gone over in greater detail in the respective pages below.

- Guarding and Parrying, a game of timing.
- HRG/MRG/TRG, all about regeneration in `JABS`.

This is a work in progress.
