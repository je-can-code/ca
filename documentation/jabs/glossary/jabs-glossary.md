# `JABS` tags
### Overview
This is a work in progress.

# Notetag tags
There are tons of tags that you can put in the notes of various elements across the database and otherwise. Here is a
relatively comprehensive list of all of them and where they can go.

---
---
---
# Action Id
The `action id` represents the event id that will be the visual representation of a usable skill in JABS.
The `action id` would be determined by you, the RM dev, from the event id that you desire a skill to use visually from
the action map. You can have re-use actions for multiple skills.

> It is important to note that actions generated from the "action map" will also follow their designated move route, allowing you to create complex actions that do crazy stuff like follow the player or wiggle randomly across the screen.

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- Skills
```

## **Tag Format**
```html
<actionId: eventIdFromActionMap>
eventIdFromActionMap = a number that maps to the event id on the action map.
```

## **Example**
```html
<actionId: 4>
- This skill will have the visual representation of event id 4 from the action map.
```

---
---
# Aggro
The `aggro` tag allows for skills to grant an arbitrary positive/negative amount of aggro to the skill performed in
addition to the aggro generated from the damage and other effects.

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- Skills
```

## **Tag Format**:
```html
<aggro: aggroModifier>
aggroModifier = a number representing how much aggro extra will be applied. Can be negative or positive.
```

## **Example**:
```html
<aggro: 100>
- This skill will generate an additional 100 aggro.

<aggro: -500>
- This skill will reduce aggro by 500.
```

---
---
# AggroInAmp
The `aggroInAmp` tag allows for states to modify incoming aggro from opposing battlers. This tag would most commonly be
used in cases where you want to make a state that reduces aggro generated from high-aggro-dealing actors. This is a
multiplier, not a flat boost.

> NOTE: If a battler has multiple states with this tag, they will stack multiplicatively.

> NOTE: If you are looking to block incoming aggro, you _can_ use this tag with `0.0`, but there is another state that
> is designed explicitly for that. See: `aggroLock`.

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- States
```

## **Tag Format**:
```html
<aggroInAmp: aggroInAmpMultiplier>
aggroInAmpMultiplier = a decimal representing the amount to multiply incoming aggro by.
```

## **Example**:
```html
<aggroInAmp: 1.5>
- This state will amplify incoming aggro by 1.5x times.

<aggroInAmp: 0.1>
- This state will reduce incoming aggro to 0.1x of its original amount.
```

---
---
# AggroOutAmp
The `aggroOutAmp` tag allows for states to modify outgoing aggro to opposing battlers. This tag would most commonly be
used in cases where you want to make a state that magnifies aggro generated by your tanky characters to maintain and
hold aggro. This is a multiplier, not a flat boost.

> NOTE: If a battler has multiple states with this tag, they will stack multiplicatively.

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- States
```

## **Tag Format**:
```html
<aggroOutAmp: aggroOutAmpMultiplier>
aggroOutAmpMultiplier = a decimal representing the amount to multiply outgoing aggro by.
```

## **Example**:
```html
<aggroOutAmp: 1.5>
- This state will amplify outgoing aggro by 1.5x times.

<aggroOutAmp: 0.1>
- This state will reduce outgoing aggro to 0.1x of its original amount.
```

---
---
# AggroLock
The `aggroLock` tag allows for states to prevent all changes of aggro for a battler. Aggro cannot be removed, reduced,
or increased. However, this does not stop opposing targets from generating aggro against this target. The most likely
use case for this would be to keep a battler locked onto a particular target.

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- States
```

## **Tag Format**:
```html
<aggroLock>
```

## **Example**:
> Just having a state applied to a battler with this tag enables the functionality for the state.

Applicable to:
- States
---
---

# AI Traits
`aiTrait` is the AI configuration for this battler on the map. As many of these traits can be applied as desired, with
each playing a role in how an enemy decides what actions to take when in-combat.

It is intended that traits be primarily used in the database on enemies, and overridden as-needed on the events that
represent enemies on the map, but it can work however you need.

> NOTE: Please do not place `follower` and `leader` on the same enemy, they are not designed to work on a single foe.

## **Tag Format**:
```yaml
<aiTrait: aiTraitCode>
"aiTraitCode" can be one of 6 options:
- careful
- executor
- reckless
- healer
- follower
- leader
```

**Example**:
```html
<aiTrait: executor>
- This battler will have the "executor" ai trait.

<aiTrait: careful>
<aiTrait: healer>
- This battle will have the "careful" AND "healer" trait.

```

## **Tag Usage**
```yaml
- Events (overrides database)
- Enemies (database)
```

---
---
# Alert Duration
The `ad` is the number of frames this battler will remain in an "alerted" state.

**Syntax**:
```html
<ad: alertDuration>
alertDuration = the number in frames that the battler remains alerted.
```

**Example**:
```html
<ad: 300>
- The battler will remain alerted for 300 frames (about a five seconds) before giving up and returning to its home coordinates.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)
---
---
# Alert Pursuit Boost
The `ap` is the amount of bonus pursuit that is gained when in an alerted state.

**Syntax**:
```html
<ap: pursuitBoost>
sightBoost = the number to add to this battler's base pursuit range while alerted.
```

**Example**:
```html
<ap: 3>
- The battler will gain +3 pursuit while in an alerted state.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)
---
---
# Alert Sight Boost
The `as` is the amount of bonus sight that is gained when in an alerted state.

**Syntax**:
```html
<as: sightBoost>
sightBoost = the number to add to this battler's base sight range while alerted.
```

**Example**:
```html
<as: 3>
- The battler will gain +3 sight while in an alerted state.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)
---
---
# Battler Id
`e` (yes, just `e`) represents the id of the battler on the map (such as an enemy of id 2 or something in the database).

**Syntax**:
```html
<e: battlerId>
battlerId = the id that this event on the map represents in the enemies tab of the database.
```

**Example**:
```html
<e: 5>
- This event on the map will use a battler based on enemy of id 5 from the database.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)
---
---
# Bonus Hits
The `bonusHits` tag allows for mainhand and offhand skills performed by this battler to hit additional times.

**Syntax**:
```html
<bonusHits: additionalHits>
additionalHits = The number of hits extra this will add to basic attack skills.
```

**Example**:
```html
<bonusHits: 3>
- Basic attack skills will hit 3 additional times.
```

> This tag adds additional hits to the pierce count of a skill. If a skill already hits multiple times, then it will hit this many more. If a skill already has a delay such as `<pierce: [3,10]>`, then in the example above it would effectively become `<pierce: [6,10]>`.

Applicable to:
- Skills (mainhand and offhand only)
---
---
# Cast Animation
The `castAnimation` is the animation that plays on the user of a skill when the skill is executed.
The skill does not wait until the cast animation is completed before executing the skill.

Syntax:
```html
<castAnimation: animationId>
animationId = the id of the animation that should be executed.
```

Example:
```html
<castAnimation: 130>
- This skill will play the animation with id 130 on the caster when the skill is executed.
```
Cast animation `notes` are applicable to:
- Skills

---
---
# Cast Time
The `castTime` is the duration in frames that a battler must spend "casting" before a skill is executed. This applies to both AI-controlled battlers and the player.

Syntax:
```html
<castTime: castDuration>
castDuration = the duration in frames to cast.
```

Example:
```html
<castTime: 180>
- This caster will be forced to wait for 180 frames (~3 seconds) upon executing the skill before the skill is actually performed.
```
Applicable to:
- Skills

---
---
# Combo
The `combo` note tag directly binds a sequential action with a reduced cooldown that a given action has.
Combo counters do not begin until a hit connects successfully with an enemy.
Combos can combo into themselves.

> After looking at the syntax and example, you'll notice I did call out that the `reducedCooldown` parameter must be shorter than the base cooldown. If the reduced cooldown is longer than the base cooldown, the window of which the sequential combo skill can be executed will not exist. If a skill has a base cooldown of 60, and the `reducedCooldown` is 10, then the player has a 50 frame window after 10 frames to hit the button again to execute the combo skill instead. If the player does not execute the skill within that window, then the next button press will execute the same skill instead.

**Syntax**:
```html
<combo: [comboSkillId, reducedCooldown]>
comboSkillId = the skill the execute instead of this skill.
reducedCooldown = the number of frames until the combo skill is available (MUST BE SHORTER THAN THE BASE COOLDOWN).
```

**Example**:
```html
<combo: [12, 10]>
- 10 frames after using this skill, a subsequent use of the skill will instead execute the skill with the id of 12.
(as long as the base cooldown has not completed)
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Cooldown
The `cooldown` is the number of frames the battler must wait until the action can be used again.

**Syntax**:
```html
<cooldown: cooldownFrames>
cooldownFrames = the number in frames that the battler must wait after executing this action to execute it again.
```

**Example**:
```html
<cooldown: 60>
- The battler must wait 60 frames before using this action again.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
- Items
---
---
# CounterGuard
The `counterGuard` allows the player to automatically retaliate with a designated skill if the player is struck by an attack at any time while guarding.

> Skills executed in this way do not have a cost nor cooldown.

**Syntax**:
```html
<counterGuard: counterGuardSkillId>
counterGuardSkillId = The skill id to automatically retaliate with.
```

**Example**:
```html
<counterGuard: 10>
- The player will automatically counter with skill id 10 if struck while guarding.
```

> Once the retaliation occurs, the guarding will end.

> You may want to visit the changes made to the CNT parameter to understand how that affects this.

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# CounterParry
The `counterParry` allows the player to automatically retaliate with a designated skill if the player is struck by an attack while within the precise-parry window. Mechanically, `counterGuard` and `counterParry` are very similar, but due to timing, it typically makes more sense to assign more potent skills to `counterParry` because the difficulty to execute is higher.

> Skills executed in this way do not have a cost nor cooldown.

**Syntax**:
```html
<counterParry: counterParrySkillId>
counterParrySkillId = The skill id to automatically retaliate with.
```

**Example**:
```html
<counterParry: 20>
- The player will automatically counter with skill id 20 if struck during a precise-parry window.
```

> Once the retaliation occurs, the both the precise-parry window AND guarding will end.

> You may want to visit the changes made to the CNT parameter to understand how that affects this.

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Direct
The `direct` tag allows for a skill to not have a projectile for targeting a battler. Instead, it will apply directly to a target if they are within `proximity`. The most common use case for this would be healing skills, since they most typically don't get fired as projectiles in hopes of hitting a target to heal.

> It is important to note that this functionality prioritizes the battler last hit for offensive skills, and typically the closest target for skills targeting your allies.

**Syntax**:
```html
<direct>
```

> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the action.

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Disabled
The `disabled` note tag prevents the battler from executing "attacks". For the player, attacks are defined as either the mainhand or offhand skills. Dodge/Tools/L1/R1 skills are not affected by this. For non-player battlers, attacks only include their "basic attack" skill.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<disabled>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the state(s).

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Duration
The `duration` is the number of frames the action will exist on the map before being disposed of.

> A few notes:
> - actions have a minimum duration of 8 frames (about a quarter second).
> - after the minimum duration, actions will automatically expire if they reached the max number of hits on an enemy.

**Syntax**:
```html
<duration: durationFrames>
durationFrames = the number in frames that the action will persist on the map.
```

**Example**:
```html
<duration: 30>
- The action will persist for 30 frames (about a half second) before being disposed of.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Free Combo
The `freeCombo` tag makes it so that a skill does not require connecting successfully with a target to execute the combo skill.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<freeCombo>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the action(s).

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Guard
The `guard` tag allows you to define the details of a skill that will represent a "defensive" skill, that can be used for defending/guarding/parrying.

> The skill with this tag **must** also be classified with the skill type that you have mapped to the "Guard Skill Type". If it is not, this tag will be ignored.

**Syntax**:
```html
<guard: [flatAmount, percentAmount]>
flatAmount = The flat amount of damage that an incoming attack will be reduced by while defending.
percentAmount = The percent amount of damage that an incoming attack will be reduced by while defending.
```
> NOTE: in favor of the player, percent is applied first, then flat is applied.

**Example**:
```html
<guard: [-20, -33]>
- Incoming damage will be reduced by 33% and then 20 from that. If an attack would've been for 200 damage, it'd be first reduce by -66 damage because of the percent reduction, then -20 from the flat reduction, resulting in an application of 114 damage to the player instead.

<guard: [50, -70]>
- Incoming damage will be reduced by 70% and then increased by 50. If an attack would've been for 200, it'd first reduce by -140 damage because of the percent reduction, then add(!) 50 from the flat reduction, resulting in an application of 110 damage to the player instead.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Guard Growth
The `grdGrowth` tag allows actors to gain arbitrary amounts of GRD per level. This was implemented due to the importance of GRD (and HIT) in the JABS engine.

**Syntax**:
```html
<grdGrowth: growthAmount>
growthAmount = The amount gained per level. Can be a decimal. Only positives are allowed.
```

**Example**:
```html
<grdGrowth: 2.5>
- This actor will gain 2.5 GRD per level (including level 1).
```

Applicable to:
- Actors
---
---
# Hit Growth
The `hitGrowth` tag allows actors to gain arbitrary amounts of HIT per level. This was implemented due to the importance of HIT (and GRD) in the JABS engine.

**Syntax**:
```html
<hitGrowth: growthAmount>
growthAmount = The amount gained per level. Can be a decimal. Only positives are allowed.
```

**Example**:
```html
<hitGrowth: 4.25>
- This actor will gain 4.25 HIT per level (including level 1).
```

Applicable to:
- Actors
---
---
# Hp Flat
The `hpFlat` is the number to modify the **hp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<hpFlat: flatAmount>
flatAmount = the amount to modify the hp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<hpFlat: 50>
- This battler's hp5 will be increased by 50.

<hpFlat: -25>
- This battler's hp5 will be reduced by 25.
```

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Hp Perc
The `hpPerc` is the number to modify the **hp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<hpPerc: percentAmount%>
percentAmount = the amount to modify the hp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<hpPerc: 10%>
- This battler's hp5 will be increased by 10% of their own max HP.

<hpPerc: -5%>
- This battler's hp5 will be reduced by 5% of their own max HP.
```

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Ignore Parry
The `ignoreParry` allows for skills to bypass either some or all of a target's parry chance.

> This note tag is only partially implemented- only <ignoreParry> works, the percentage functionality is not available.

**Syntax**:
```html
<ignoreParry>

or

<ignoreParry: ignoreParryValue>
ignoreParryValue = percent of parry value to ignore.
```

**Example**:
```html
<ignoreParry>
- this action cannot be parried.

<ignoreParry: 25>
- this action ignores 25% of the parry chance of the target.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Inanimate
The `inanimate` note tag is a shorthand for both `<noIdle>` and `<noHpBar>`. Additionally, `inanimate` events on the map cannot be engaged with (though you can still hit them).

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<inanimate>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the battler(s).

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
---
---
# Invincible
The `invincible` note tag makes it so that a battler no longer can be collided with.
Actions will pass through them and have no effect.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<invincible>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the battler(s).

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
---
---
# Knockback
The `knockback` allows for skills to knock back the target by `X` amount.
Knockback can be negative, resulting in pulling an enemy closer.
Knockback is reduced by `knockback resist`.

> This functionality has had some quirkiness about it, resulting randomly in sending the battler flying. I'm sorry. I'll fix it eventually.

**Syntax**:
```html
<knockback: knockbackPower>
knockbackPower = the number of squares/spaces/tiles to knock the target back.
```

**Example**:
```html
<knockback: 2>
- this action will knock the target back up to 2 tiles.
```

> "up to 2 tiles" as in, when trying to knock back the target, if the 2nd tile is impassible, then it will stop at 1.

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Knockback Resist
`Knockback resist` represents the percentage of knockback that is ignored from an opposing JABS battler.
Knockback resist is a percent resistance to being knocked back. Having 100 resistance means you simply won't be knocked up, back, or anywhere.

**Syntax**:
```html
<knockbackResist: resistanceValue>
resistanceValue = some number between 0-100.
```

**Example**:
```html
<knockbackResist: 75>
- Resists 75% of the knockback value that an enemy's knockback power.

If their skill had a knockback of 4, but you had 75% knockback resist, then you'd only be knocked back 1 instead.
```

Applicable to:
- Actors
- Enemies
---
---
# Loot Expiration
The `expires` tag allows for an item to have a custom-defined time in frames that it will persist on the map before expiring (disappearing forever).

> This tag will override the default in the plugin parameters of JABS.

**Syntax**:
```html
<expires: timeInFramesBeforeExpiration>
timeInFramesBeforeExpiration = the number of frames this loot will persist on the map before expiring.
```

**Example**:
```html
<expires: 600>
- This loot will expire in 600 frames (~10 seconds) after an enemy drops it.
```

> This is currently only applicable to item drops, not weapon/armor drops.

Applicable to:
- Items
---
---
# Move Speed
`ms` is an optional note tag. It permits the assignment of custom movespeed values to an event on the map... but not just any custom values, DECIMAL custom values. If you do not use this note, then it'll just use whatever is in the event's first page.

**Syntax**:
```html
<ms: customMoveSpeed>
customMoveSpeed = the custom move speed value (probably decimal) that you want this event to have.
```

**Example**:
```html
<ms: 3.5>
- This battler's movespeed will be set to 3.5.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
---
---
# Move Type
`MoveType` is an identifier for the type of dodge skill this is.
There are only three options for this:
- `forward` : move the battler in the same direction they are facing.
- `backward` : move the battler in the opposite direction they are facing.
- `directional` : move the battler in any of the four directions, depending on what direction is being held at time of cast.

**Syntax**:
```html
<moveType: type>
type = either `forward`, `backward`, or `directional`. 
```

**Example**:
```html
<moveType: backward>
- This dodge skill will move the player in the opposite direction that they are facing when the skill is cast.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Mp Flat
The `mpFlat` is the number to modify the **mp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<mpFlat: flatAmount>
flatAmount = the amount to modify the mp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<mpFlat: 50>
- This battler's mp5 will be increased by 50.

<mpFlat: -25>
- This battler's mp5 will be reduced by 25.
```

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Mp Perc
The `mpPerc` is the number to modify the **mp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<mpPerc: percentAmount%>
percentAmount = the amount to modify the mp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<mpPerc: 10%>
- This battler's mp5 will be increased by 10% of their own max MP.

<mpPerc: -5%>
- This battler's mp5 will be reduced by 5% of their own max MP.
```

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Muted
The `muted` note tag prevents the battler from executing "skills". For the player, skills are defined as any skill triggered by holding L1/R1. Mainhand/offhand/dodge/tools are not affected by this. For non-player battlers, skills are any skill that the battler knows that isn't it's "basic attack" skill.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<muted>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the state(s).

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# No HP Bar
The `noHpBar` note tag disables the visibility of the hp bar that is over all active battlers (except the player).

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<noHpBar>
```
> Just having this tag on an event enables this functionality.

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
---
---
# No Idle
The `noIdle` note tag disables the AI-controlled battler's idle wanderings that occur when they are not engaged in battle or alerted.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<noIdle>
```
> Just having this tag on an event enables this functionality.

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
---
---
# Paralyzed
The `paralyzed` tag prevents the battler from taking any action while afflicted with a state that has this note on it. This is the equivalent of being `muted`, `rooted`, and `disabled` all at the same time.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<paralyzed>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the state(s).

Applicable to:
- States
---
---
# Parry
The `parry` tag allows a guard skill to also grant the ability to "precise-parry". Precise-parry is a small window of time that begins the instant the player presses the guard button and counts down for the provided number of frames. If the player is struck by an incoming attack during this window, the attack is completely mitigated and the parry ends. If the skill also has a `<counterParry: skillId>` tag, then that skill will be automatically executed in retaliation.

**Syntax**:
```html
<parry: parryWindow>
parryWindow = The number of frames that would result in a precise-parry if struck within.
```

**Example**:
```html
<parry: 12>
- 
```

> The ability to precise-parry is also reduced/mitigated by the `<ignoreParry>` tag.

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Pierce
`pierce` represents the concept of a single action hitting multiple times.

> There is no limit to the number of times a single action can hit a foe, but it is important to know that this counter is per enemy. If a single action hits multiple enemies, it can hit all enemies this many times each. This is obviously limited by the collision size.

**Syntax**:
```html
<pierce: [pierceCount, pierceDelay]>
pierceCount = the number of times this single action can hit a foe.
pierceDelay = the delay in frames between each successive hit from the same action.
```

**Example**:
```html
<pierce: [2, 3]>
- This skill can hit a maximum of 2 times, with a delay of 3 frames between each hit.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Pose Suffix
`poseSuffix` is an extremely crude means of "posing" when executing a skill. The most common usecase for this would be to show your player's battler swinging a sword when they execute the sword slash attack or something. However, it also works with enemy battlers and such, too.

Does not support posing to non-indexed spritesheets. (files prefixed with $, such as $BigMonster1.png)

This also autocycles through patterns, but it is hard coded to start at 2, then drop to 1 and 0 at the end of the pose. This is on my list of things to upgrade to a more robust pose functionality.

**Syntax**:
```html
<poseSuffix: [spriteSuffix, spriteIndex, poseDuration]>
spriteSuffix = the suffix to append to the name of your battler's spritesheet.
spriteIndex = the index to use on the spritesheet to pose.
poseDuration = the number of frames to spend posing in this spritesheet.
```

**Example**:
```html
<poseSuffix: ["-atk", 0, 12]>
- If your battler's spritesheet was named "chara_je.png", then it'd look for "chara_je-atk.png".
- It would take the 0th index character (upper left most sprite) from that sheet.
- And spend 12 frames in that pose before reverting back to the original spritesheet.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills
---
---
# Prepare Time
`prepare` is the amount of time in frames an AI-controlled battler spends in phase 1 of the AI. This is effectively the time until their turn is ready. During this time, they may or may not move depending on their AI configuration.

Does not affect the player-controlled character.

**Syntax**:
```html
<prepare: prepareFrames>
prepareFrames = the minimum distance (in squares/spaces/tiles) away to execute the skill.
```

**Example**:
```html
<prepare: 120>
- The battler must wait 120 frames before proceeding to phase 2 of the AI.
```

Applicable to:
- Enemies
- Actors

# Proximity
`proximity` is the minimum distance that an AI-controlled battler must be from its target in order to execute this action.

Does not affect the player-controlled character.

**Syntax**:
```html
<proximity: minimumDistance>
minimumDistance = the minimum distance (in squares/spaces/tiles) away to execute the skill.
```

**Example**:
```html
<proximity: 2>
- The battler must be within 2 squares/spaces/tiles before it will try to execute the skill.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills

# Pursuit
`p` (yes, just `p`) represents the distance of which this battler will pursue its currently engaged target. This should typically be greater than the battler's sight range. If the target leaves this range, it will disengaged and return to it's "home" coordinates.

> Similar to sight, this is absolute distance. Battlers can see through impassable terrain.

**Syntax**:
```html
<p: pursuitRange>
pursuitRange = the maximum distance this battler will pursue a target.
```

**Example**:
```html
<p: 8>
- Once engaged, this battler will remain engaged so long as the the target is within 8 squares/spaces/tiles.
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)

# Range
`range` affects the size of shapes/hitboxes for an action. The more `range`, the bigger/longer the hitbox for the action.

**Syntax**:
```html
<radius: rangeValue>
rangeValue = the size/range of the skill.
```

**Example**:
```html
<radius: 2>
- the action can potentially hit up to 2 squares/spaces/tiles away/wide/far (see the shapes section).
```

Applicable to:
- Skills

# Retaliate
`retaliate` allows a battler to automatically perform a skill when being struck. Applicable to enemies only. The idea behind this was to build a thorns-like functionality, allowing the enemies to hitback whenever struck to the attacker with a particular skill. The player has an equivalent functionality requiring skill/timing called `counterGuard` and `counterParry`.

**Syntax**:
```html
<retaliate: skillId>
skillId = the id of the skill to automatically perform.
```

**Example**:
```html
<retaliate: 2>
- The enemy battler will automatically execute skill id 2 upon being struck.
```

Applicable to:
- Enemies (in the database)

# Rooted
The `rooted` note tag prevents the battler from moving. Attacking and skills can still be used.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<rooted>
```
> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the state(s).

Applicable to:
- States

# Shape
`shape` is literally the shape of the hitbox for the collision of this action. This can be only one of a variety of different options:
- `rhombus` : A diamond-like shape. More range means bigger diamond.
- `square` : A square shape. Similar to `rhombus`, but rotated 45 degrees. More range means bigger square.
- `frontsquare` : A `square` that is truncated to be only infront of the battler/action. More range means bigger square.
- `line` : A 1-tile width line that stretches further based on range in a single direction.
- `arc` : The most common shape: a `rhombus` truncated to be only infront of the battler/action. Often used for things like a sword slash. More range means a the arc reaches further.
- `wall` : A 1-tile depth line that stretches to the left & right of the battler/action. More range means it stretches further left and right (not thicker, the `wall` will only ever have a distance of 1 infront of the battler/action).
- `cross` : A cross-shaped hitbox that will only ever be 1-tile thick. Goes in four directions from the battler/action.

> I would like to give credit to **Moghunter** for being the foundation of the collision functionality, though one may not recognize his code after the multiple iterations it went through, but it was there and I thank him for involuntarily giving me a launching point.

**Syntax**:
```html
<hitbox: theShape>
theShape = the shape of this action. See above for the available options.
```

**Example**:
```html
<hitbox: arc>
- the action will hit in an arc-shape, dependent on how big the range is.
```

Applicable to:
- Skills

# Sight
`s` (yes, just `s`) represents the distance of which this battler can perceive other battlers for engagement and otherwise.

> Currently, battlers can "see" through walls, for this is not actual sight, just a distance.

**Syntax**:
```html
<s: sightRange>
sightRange = the maximum distance this battler can "see".
```

**Example**:
```html
<s: 4>
- This battler will see and engage on enemy battlers within 4 distance (tiles/squares/spaces).
```

Applicable to:
- Events (on the map)
- Actors (in the database)
- Classes (in the database)
- Enemies (in the database)

# Skill Id
The `skillId` note tag binds an item/weapon/armor to a skill.

> The only armor that is considered is "offhand" armors, or your second weapon if dual-wielding.

**Syntax**:
```html
<skillId: skillIdValue>
skillIdValue = the skill id that this weapon/item links to.
```

**Example**:
```html
<skillId: 10>
- If on an item, then this item will execute the skill with id of 10 after applying the item effects.
- If on a mainhand weapon, then this weapon will execute the skill with id of 10 when pressing the mainhand attack button.
- If on an offhand weapon/armor, then this offhand equip will execute the skill with id of 10 when pressing the offhand attack button.
```

Applicable to:
- Items
- Weapons
- Armors

# Tp Flat
The `tpFlat` is the number to modify the **tp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<tpFlat: flatAmount>
flatAmount = the amount to modify the tp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<tpFlat: 50>
- This battler's tp5 will be increased by 50.

<tpFlat: -25>
- This battler's tp5 will be reduced by 25.
```

Applicable to:
- States

# Tp Perc
The `tpPerc` is the number to modify the **tp5** regeneration value by.

> It is recommended to read the section regarding the changes made to regeneration.

**Syntax**:
```html
<tpPerc: percentAmount%>
percentAmount = the amount to modify the tp5 regeneration value by. Can be negative or positive.
```

**Example**:
```html
<tpPerc: 10%>
- This battler's tp5 will be increased by 10% of their own max TP.

<tpPerc: -5%>
- This battler's tp5 will be reduced by 5% of their own max TP.
```

> It is worth noting that the base max TP is fixed at 100 unless you're using other plugins,
> so this is effectively the same as using `tpFlat`.

# Unique Cooldown
The `uniqueCooldown` note tag makes it so that a skill does not affect other skill slots that have the same skill equipped.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<uniqueCooldown>
```

> Just having this tag enables the functionality for the action(s).

Applicable to:
- Skills

# Use On Pickup
The `useOnPickup` tag allows for creating items that automatically apply to the player as soon as they are collected. For example, you could create a "heart" as seen in the zelda franchise that heals the player as soon as it is collected from an enemy that dropped it.

**Syntax** & **Example**:
```html
<useOnPickup>
```

> Just having this tag on an item enables the functionality for all instances of the item when dropped as loot.

Applicable to:
- Items
