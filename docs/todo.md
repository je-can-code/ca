# TODOs

## Incomplete Map TODOs

### Adventurer's Fork
#### Path to the North
This is available, but not yet implemented at all. It should lead to `FIELD: Desolate Graves`, but be gated by a tool,
possibly the "torch"-like tool?


### FIELD: Raevula's Heartbeat
#### Riverside Stroll
There is a `Suspicious Crack` wall that is partially implemented with a `Durable Post` pair inside. The person beyond
there should be a rescuable person for a side quest or something that can unlock stuff in town- perhaps teaches you how
to upgrade your named weapons?

#### Stone's Throw / A River Receded
There is a `Durable Post` pair that suggests there should be something behind the waterfall, but its not implemented at
all. Perhaps it should reveal a named weapon (wand)?


### DUNGEON: Pearl Salt Mines
#### Northwestern Depths (southern caverns)
There is a `Durable Post` pair that connects to an unimplemented map.
Perhaps some loot should be here?

#### Dangerous Oneway (southern caverns)
There is a chest reachable by a pair of `Durable Posts`, but its contents have not yet been determined.
Perhaps it should be a flux drive?

#### Deeper We Go (southern caverns)
There is a `Durable Post` pair here that ultimately will lead to the `Subterranean Depths`, but that place is
completely unimplemented.

#### Downward Spiral (southern caverns)
There is a `Durable Post` pair here that leads somewhere undetermined.
Perhaps it should lead to a different location within the `Subterranean Depths`?

#### AREA: Northern Caverns
There is currently no purpose for the player to explore other areas of the northern reaches of the `Pearl Salt Mines`.
Perhaps this should have new deposits for `Pearl Salt` (rarely) and other ore?

#### Offshoot N (northern caverns)
There is nothing here, but it was intended to have a `Suspicious Crack` leading to somewhere in the `Negative Peaks`.


### DUNGEON: Subterranean Depths
This is a completely unimplemented dungeon that is reachable after acquiring `Snakerope`.


### DUNGEON: Forest of Dreams
#### Marshy Secret (riverside path)
It is named "secret", but there is nothing significant here. Perhaps add a named monster?

#### Mad Hops (riverside path)
This is a pretty significant path out of the way with no return. Perhaps add some loot or a named monster?

#### Peaceful Respite (forest depths)
There is a well that is reachable by a `Durable Post` pair, but is not implemented.
Perhaps it should be a secret dungeon of some sort?


### FIELD: Outer Cliffs
#### Terraced Cliffside
There is a `Suspicious Crack` wall that should be able to be reached by dropping down (but it can't at the moment).

#### Inconspicuous Hole
There are multiple torches that should be lit by an uncreated "torch"-like tool.
Perhaps it should grant access to a path leading to the beach?

#### Connector to More Cliffs
There is a `Durable Post` that leads to presumably more cliffs- but they aren't implemented yet.


### DUNGEON: Forlorn Basin
#### Passage 8
There is a `Durable Post` pair here that leads to what appears to be an alternative depths to the main story path.
Perhaps this should lead into somewhere in the middle of the `Subterranean Depths`?


### FIELD: Negative Peaks
#### Preparing to Ascend
There is a `Durable Post` pair that leads presumably to the maps that make up the `Negative Peaks`, but they are not
implemented.


### FIELD: Lakeside Road
#### Frozen Fortress
There is an `overly advanced gate` and an `out-of-place frozen fortress` here, gated by an un-implemented "keycard"
tool. This'll ultimately lead to the dungeon of `Frozen Fortress`, but it also is un-implemented.

#### Derelict Fork (going south)
There is a `Durable Post` pair that leads to the south, which ultimately will bring the player to the `Deluge Plains`,
but that place hasn't been woven into the story (the maps exist, though).

#### Derelict Fork (going east)
There is a `Durable Post` pair inside the connector map, which ultimately will lead the player to the `Frostbite
Fields`, but that place isn't implemented.


### DUNGEON: Erocia Isthmus
#### Distant Hill
There is a `Durable Post` pair which leads to nothing.
Perhaps add some enemies and a secret dungeon and/or loot/named enemy?

#### Watery Path
There is a `Durable Post` pair which ultimately will lead the player to the `Crystalline Ravine`, but that place isn't
implemented yet.


### FIELD: Highwater Way
#### Eastern / Western Ways
Both of these maps have only enemies on them, perhaps they should have loot and a named enemy?


### DUNGEON: Volcanis Grotto
#### The Bellows
There are many `Durable Post` pairs that lead no where. Perhaps they should lead further into the grotto somehow?


## Incomplete Feature TODOs

### Alchemy Pages
There have been no placement of any pages from the Alchemist's Journal. These need to be placed to grant the player the
ability to unlock new alchemy recipes.

### Named Weapons
There are numerous named weapons that have yet to be placed.
Consult [The weapons section for more details][1]

### Named Enemies
There are numerous named enemies that should exist, but have yet to be created to add variance to the regions.
