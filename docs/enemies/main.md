## Undead (5)

### Ghost

Ghosts are typically "careful" and tend to be a bit more defensive in stats.

- (4)  [101]Ghosty
- (3)  [102]Ghostie
- (5)  [103]!Ghastly Ghosty
- (26) [104]Spooky
- (52) [105]Tsukumogami

### Reborn

Reborn typically seek out weaknesses with their "executor" trait, and lean into offensive force-based attacks.

- (10) [111]Wraith
- (15) [112]!Spoop Maestro

### Wisp

Since Wisps are basically intangible spiritual entities, their are heavily force and resist-centric, but inherently are
not fast by any stretch of the imagination. Due to the fact that they are primal spirits, they tend to "recklessly"
spam thier abilities without constraint.

- (8)  [121]Will 'o' Wisp
- (26) [122]!Blistering Blaze
- (49) [123]Onryo

### Skelly

Skeleton types tend to run in pairs or packs, with a single leader skeleton and many skeledoggos.

The leader skeletons were probably intelligent at one point so they tend to "execute" your weak points.

The doggos can't do any tricks if they have no leader, but have some vicious moves that their leader will command them
to execute if letting them stay together.

- (22) [131]Skeletor
- (20) [132]Skeledoggo

### Necro

- (??) [??]Necromancer

---

## Reptile (5)

### Snake

In the snake sub-family, there are two distinct types of snakes that one will encounter: snakes (like the animal), and
lamias (human + snake).

Snakes are notorious for being swift and deadly, high crit rate combined with poisons or bleeds
which can lead to unexpected death.

Lamias tend to play it safe and careful, leveraging magic when possible and doing
damage from afar, using their intellect to lead allies to execute dangerous plans.

- (30) [152]!Vice Cobra
- (37) [153]Lamia
- (51) [154]Asp

### Dragon

Dragons have always boasted high raw stats across the board, and they are no exception in this game. They also often
are paired with a high level of recklessness due to their ego.
