# Map: Raevula

Raevula is the main "hub city" that you'll be visiting frequently over the course of this game. It is divided into four
sections, aptly named after their directions NE/SE/SW/NW sections.

```
Raevula has no enemies directly within it.

---
## Northeast Raevula: The Main Gate
The Northeastern section of `Raevula` is where the entrance to this "hub city" resides. Additionally, following shops
and/or buildings are available in this section:
- `The Comfy Bear Inn`
- `Forgotten Shrine` (save point)
- `The Red Baron Pub`
- `Mysterious Facility` (aka the [spacial flux engine][1])
- `Outdoor Merchantiles`

##### The Comfy Bear Inn
This is the next story destination. Immediately upon entering, an event will trigger unlocking the first real quest:
`defeat some bearcats`. It is not a complicated quest, but doing this will unlock the use of the innkeeper's kitchen
for crafting food and drink.

Since it is known that you need a place to cook so you can `Craft an Erocian Pudding` (the current objective), the next
step should be chopping up the bearcats right outside of town as indicated by the innkeeper.

With the current goal being `Craft an Erocian Pudding`, to proceed, you'll need to complete the quest the innkeeper
provided, and use the `Big Gelatin` that was dropped by the `Erocian Slime` boss previously defeated in the intro cave.

##### Forgotten Shrine
It is a save room. Just stand on the glowing sigil to bring up the save menu. You should do this often since this game
does NOT utilize any autosaving functionality.

##### The Red Baron Pub
There is not much currently available to do here, but the side quest for unlocking the crafting system will lead you
into this pub briefly.

> TODO: add a couple of side quests to people in this pub.

##### Mysterious Facility
This abandoned and rundown facility is where the `Spacial Flux Engine` is unlocked, and where `Spacial Flux Routines`
are turned in. After it is unlocked, this is a place that should be frequently visited if the game is not the correct
difficulty.

##### Outdoor Merchantiles
The sketchy and rude merchant will sell already-crafted goods and some materials for a price. It is probably a good
idea to visit him from time to time. As the chapters progress, he will update his wares.

## Southeast Raevula: The Mining Quarters
The Southeastern section of `Raevula` contains one point of significance:
- `The Metal Petal` (the smiths)

##### The Metal Petal
There are two smiths that dwell in this building, `Victor` and `Viskra`. `Victor` is the primary smith guy hanging out
over by the water pools and fireplaces. You can talk to him over the course of your time in `Raevula` and he will
provide lore, dialogue, and eventually unlocks for more recipes and functionalities. `Viskra` is the one who manages
the business portion of the shop, and is available for chatter behind the main counter in the front. She will sell the
latest tier of craftable weaponry available.

When you first arrive in the smith's shop, `Victor` is no where to be found, but `Viskra` will present you with a side
quest that will unlock `Victor` and ultimately unlock smithing for you to do at your leisure.

> The side quest for unlocking `Smithing` is vital, albeit not required, though you'll really want the functionality to
> be able to **craft** (create) and eventually **refine** (upgrade) your equipment- its a crux of this game.

## Southwest Raevula: Butterflies and Alchemy
The Southwestern section of `Raevula` is home to a single significant point of interest:
- `The Withered Thorn` (alchemy shop)

##### The Withered Thorn
The Southwestern section of `Raevula` also only contains one point of significance: the alchemist `Leo` and his
assistant acolyte `Alice`. `The Withered Thorn` is the name of the alchemy shop that `Leo` runs with his assistant, but
it is not available on your first pass through `Raevula`.

---
## Northwest Raevula: The Imposing Mansion
The Northwestern section of `Raevula` has two locations of significance:
- `The Mayor's Mansion`
- The rumor-loving lady

##### The Mayor's Mansion
This is effectively a story location that becomes available as a part of the main story after crafting the `Erocian
Pudding`. `Jerald` will call out shortly after entering that there is indeed a point of no return, and that you should
be careful about entering if unprepared.

##### The rumor-loving lady
This is just another NPC, namely the one standing stationary in front of the plot of land that looks like there was
previously a house there. After some dialogue, she informs you that there used to be a house where she was standing,
but the owner abandoned the house and took it with her to the forest. Listening to this lady is required to unlock the
ability to craft armor and accessories later when you visit the forest.
