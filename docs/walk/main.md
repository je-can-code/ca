The game of Chef Adventure is broken up into **chapters**. The **chapters** are arbitrary in content available, and
range wildly in duration. I intend to use the first three **chapters** as a means of introduction to the general
gameplay loop including its multiple systems that make this action RPG _a little
bit different_ from others, resulting in what I project to be approximately 10-20 hours of gameplay depending on the
player and how familiar they are with the content and gameplay style.

To keep things in order, here is some documentation about each of those chapters, written in plain english rather than
the series of events that are within RPG Maker MZ's numerous events across hundreds of maps.
