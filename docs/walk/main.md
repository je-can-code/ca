The game of Chef Adventure is broken up into **chapters**. The **chapters** are arbitrary in content available, but
generally speaking, each **chapter** is loosely 1-2 hours of gameplay. I intend to use the first three **chapters** as
a means of introduction to the general gameplay loop including its multiple systems that make this action RPG _a little
bit different_ from others.

To keep things in order, here is some documentation about each of those chapters, written in plain english rather than
the series of events that are within RPG Maker MZ's numerous events across hundreds of maps.
