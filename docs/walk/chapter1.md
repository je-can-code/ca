# Chapter 1

> NOTE: This is WIP; I am writing it for myself at this time so I can return back to this more seamlessly later.
>   This will likely be enhanced as a full guide as time goes on. If you found this without me personally directing
>   you to it, read at your own discretion!

### Overview
Chapter 1 is the main introductory chapter. It'll cover all the way up through an introduction to the hub city of the
game, Raevula. At this point, it isn't really made clear that the town is the "hub city" of the game, but that will be
gradually introduced as the player is continually returned to the city.

> All named enemies except for the tutorial named enemy have a (50%) chance to drop either blueprint scrap available in
> this chapter. Before you ask, you could potentially get both from a single named enemy.

### <a name="step1" /> Step 1: Learning from the Lair of Erocian Death

The game opens after selecting `New Game!` from the title screen, by dropping the player abruptly inside the entrance
to `Lair of Erocian Death`. This is a highly over-dramatized name for the intro dungeon, but the goal of this dungeon
is to introduce the player to the basic controls.

As such, the player will be forced to navigate forward through the cave to continue the story.

| name                | drop % | description                                                   |
|---------------------|:------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ghosty              |  30%   | Reduces defenses and aggro generation, but increases offense. |
| !Gilbert Von Ghosty |  50%   | (an improved drop rate of the Ghosty's panel)                 |
| Erocian Slime*      |  `--`  | `This enemy does not drop a panel.`                           |

#### Room 1: Where you start
Nothing special happens here. It just opens and informs the player that they should proceed. The player should also be
blocked from exiting the cave at this point.

#### Room 2: How to attack
The player is introduced to the ever-infamous enemy: `The Ghosty`. The purpose for being introduced to this enemy is to
learn what the attack button is. The player doesn't actually have to defeat `The Ghosty` to proceed, but it only takes
one full combo to obliterate, so it is projected the player will defeat it.

#### Room 3: How to use combat skills
Here there is a couple of things the player is introduced to. The first and most important are combat skills. The
second is **Named Enemies**. 

> **Named Enemies** are unique enemies that typically only appear in a specific location under certain circumstances.

#### Room 4: How to guard
The player will see that there are auto-firing fireballs all around. While they are probably easy enough to dodge,
`Rupert` uses this opportunity to remind `Jerald` that _he has a weakness to fire_ ðŸ”¥, and that he should actually try
to guard or parry the fireballs instead. Sure, it doesn't make sense, but it works!

#### Room 5: What is a Trap Room
This room is distinctly shaped with a number of `Ghosty` enemies around the room. Upon entering, the player will be
alerted that the room is locked and that they must defeat the enemies! That is all. Just chop up all visible enemies to
proceed. There should be 8 of them, with no restriction on how to defeat them.

> The concept of a `Trap Room` will be re-used repeatedly throughout this game.

#### Room 6: How to use ranged attacks
In this room, the player will automatically be party cycled to `Rupert` and dropped into yet another `Trap Room` with
some `Ghosty` enemies that are out of reach of `Jerald`'s attacks. It is encouraged to use `Rupert`'s basic attack or
his **Fireball** spell to take down the enemies across the gap.

At this point, `Rupert`'s basic attack is a three-way shot that costs a significant amount of his MP. While `Jerald`'s
offhand skill is actually the ability to guard/parry thanks to his starting equipment, `Rupert`'s offhand skill is not
to parry, but instead use `Rejuvenate`, a "Liquid"-elemental spell that heals the user's MP both upfront and over time.
If you should run out of MP, you can just wait for it to naturally recover, or use this skill.

#### Room 7: Down and Around
This section of the cave is purely exploratory. Going down the rope should be automatic after a point, and then just
navigate back up towards the front of the map where the bubbles were. Interacting with the bubbles brings you to the
next map- your first boss!

#### Room 8: The Erocian Slime Boss
This is the player's first boss battle, as indicated by the "boss gauge" showing up at the top. The `Erocian Slime` is
is basically just a normal enemy that has a bit more health than the other enemies. After chopping or burning it up,
the player is prompted to climb the newly spawned vines, which lead the player back to "Room 1"!

The player is now offered a save panel, and able to exit the cave.

### <a name="step2" /> Step 2: Going to ~~the store~~ Raevula

After a rugged tutorial like that, it is nice to see greenery, right? Well get used to it, because many maps in this
game utilize this same tileset, so you'll be seeing it a lot!

The journey to Raevula is a relatively small one. A hop skip and a jump through a few maps chopping up mobs and you'll
well be on your way to the "hub city"!

> TIP: It is highly recommended to farm for Nodes and Node points here! Since you will only have 2 given to you from
>   the story, it is almost required that the player farm Nodes to some extent.

| name              | drop % | description                                                                       |
|-------------------|:------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Needler           |   8%   | Grants a mobility skill upon mastery, along with other useful offensive stats.    |
| Wolftrap          |   5%   | Improves Max MP and other supporting magi-centric stats.                          |
| Bearcat           |   5%   | Both offensive and defensive parameters; a great beginner node for any character. |
| Kappa             |   2%   | A rare family of panels that grants fortune and accuracy and a new skill.         |
| Erocian Slimette* |   2%   | All in on survivability with Max HP and regen.                                    |

#### Map 1: Adventurer's Road
This is the first map including proper greenery, and thus including a much more upbeat BGM (thanks to Ys9)! Here, the
player _can_ (skippable) learn about `party cycling`, `accessing the quick menu`, and is promptly introduced to the
first humanoid that isn't in your party: `???`, where the player can learn about the "Node System" (aka my SDP system).

> NOTE: All enemies currently found on the following few maps are also found past the "point of no return for a while",
>   with a single exception of a somewhat-hidden enemy: the `Erocian Slimette`. This `Erocian Slimette` is a lesser
>   version of the `Erocian Slime` boss that was just defeated, except that it has the opportunity to drop a `Node`! It
>   is definitely in your interest to return back into the cave and take the shortcut back into the boss room and grind
>   those `Erocian Slimette` enemies to get that `Node` before proceeding! If you choose not to, you'll still be able
>   to acquire it later.

#### Map 2: Riverside Stroll
Aptly named for its massive body of water that the player will travel beside while navigating the map. Here the player
will be introduced to the concept of saving (as in, explained that it should happen, despite the fact that a save point
did appear in the intro cave after defeating the boss).

Additionally, there is an entrance to the `Pearl Salt Mines` (aka "the mines") here, but the enemies are likely to be
much stronger than the player at this point, and it is strongly recommended to NOT enter here. Even if you could enter
here, without the `Snakerope`, there is little to explore... but there are enemies to chop up.

Lastly, there is a cracked wall susceptible to bombing here, but without `Bombs` and a `Snakerope`, there is still not
really much that the player can do here.

> TODO: move the save tutorial over to the intro cave.

#### Map 3: Up and Down
This map is mostly just more of the same. The only goal is to reach the other end of the map. Do be careful of the
`Kappa` enemies near the water, they are a bit stronger than most of the enemies in the area at the level you are
probably at.

#### Map 4: Stone's Throw
A rather small map, but important one. There is a small waterfall and a tiny cliff to jump off of after listening to
some dialogue between `Jerald` and `Rupert`. Once you're ready, accept the offer to jump off the edge of the tiny cliff
and land safely on the other side of the water. Once you've landed, proceed to the left/west to the last map before you
reach `Raevula`!

#### Map 5: Raevula Entrance
While this map is called the "entrance", it is still technically outside the walls of `Raevula`. There are two paths to
the left, the upper leads towards `Negative Peaks`, while the lower leads into `Raevula`. Duty compels you to go into
town, so that should be your next stop!

### <a name="step3" /> Step 3: Navigating Raevula

```
Raevula has no enemies directly within it.
```

Already traveling a short journey, the tired protagonists are ready for a relaxing break in a resort town.
Unfortunately, they just arrived in `Raevula`, and while things seem relatively normal with people milling about, there
is a certain uneasiness that `Rupert` detects. After a few activities in `Raevula`, the protagonists will conclude
chapter 1 and find themselves helplessly lost in their hunt for more recipeeeees.

Before proceeding with the story, it is strongly recommended you do a lap around the town and meet the various
townsfolk and learn about the various facilities that are available in this "hub city", including unlocking the smith
via the sidequest found in `Southwestern Raevula`, and trying out some of the other weapons that are available.

> You can learn more about what is in `Raevula` by visiting [the map detail page][2].

Once you are done exploring, your actual objective would be to enter `The Comfy Bear Inn`, which will automatically
trigger some dialogue between the protagonists and the innkeeper ultimately leading to your first quest with the reward
being eternal free use of the inn's kitchen.

#### First: Your First Real Quest: Monster Slaying
The first quest is pretty straight-forward: exit the inn and head to the right to leave town. There will be four
bearcat enemies hanging about that weren't previously there. Defeating them will trigger more dialogue and allow you to
return to the inn and unlock the kitchen for crafting!

#### Second: Craft the Pudding
After unlocking the kitchen, you'll gain initial access to the JAFTING (crafting) system!

> While the main quest demands you craft the pudding, it would not be a bad idea to try to hunt down the materials for
> crafting some of the other recipes before the "point of no return" coming up next. The innkeeper herself sells some
> materials, while the merchant in `Northeastern Raevula` will sell some other things of interest (including
> pre-crafted food and accessories!).

You should already have the ingredients thanks to defeating the `Erocian Slime` in intro cave. After crafting the
pudding, `Jerald` and `Rupert` will share some dialogue, and determine the next destination should be to investigate
the town, specifically that blue-roofed big ass house in the `Northwestern Raevula`.

#### Third: Visit the Mayor
Considering there is exactly **ONE** blue-roofed house in all of `Raevula`, and it is in the `Northwestern` section, it
should be easy locating the building.

> If you actually did a lap around the town, you may have noticed that the `Mayor's Mansion` had a guard blocking
> entry into the mansion. That guard is gone now.

Enter into the building, and after a few steps, `Jerald` will chime in to let you know that you're about to cross a
"point of no return". Though you will eventually return, you'll be forced to go through an entire dungeon without being
able to restock on items or other craftable goodies.

Once ready, proceed past the "point of no return" and watch some story interactions between `Jerald` and `Rupert`, and
the Mayor and his Page.

Ultimately, you'll be led to "the Western Wing", where the Page will mention that there were adventurers that
previously came through here, but disappeared mysteriously. When `Jerald` notices that exiting the room is impossible
thanks to the overpowered guard, you'll be prompted to explore the room.

> It is encouraged to check out the two shelves right of the cooking station in this room. You'll get a bundle of free
> cooking equipment and ingredients to craft some food for the dungeon ahead!

When you're ready to move on, interact with the twinkling statue in the top-right area of the room, specifically the
**upper left statue**. `Rupert` will notice that the statue has been moved, so obviously `Jerald` should move it, too.
So he does, exposing a patchwork mess of a wall that you'll get to knock down through combat, twice. Jumping down the
hole will lead to the first real dungeon of the game, `The Pearl Salt Mines`.

### <a name="step4" /> Step 4: First Spelunk in the Pearl Salt Mines

#### Recommended Level: 7-9
Since this is the first on-your-own dungeon, going forward there will be a level recommendation for each area as you
progress so you can ensure you're not getting totally stomped, or steamrolling the place (of course you may end up
steamrolling the place thanks to `nodes`, but level also makes a significant difference in damage given/taken!).

The level recommendation for the first pass through this dungeon is somewhere between 7 and 9. The lowest level enemy
here is the `Cave Bat` at level 6, while the highest level enemies are the `Minitaur` and `Wraith` at level 10. As long
as you are strong enough to hack up the bats without much issue, you'll probably be alright chopping up the rest of the
enemies as you progress.

This dungeon is infamously long and drawn out for a first dungeon, but the enemies will only get easier as you grow
stronger and stronger thanks to your `node junction system` and levels.

> TIP: It is strongly recommended to AVOID AT ALL COSTS the orc-looking enemies strewn throughout the mines!
>   They are intentionally too strong for you to defeat now, but you'll come back later and can farm them for their
>   nodes to your heart's content. Due to this, their monster information will be absent from this step's walkthrough.

| name           | drop % | description                                                                   |
|----------------|:------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cave Bat       |   5%   | A simple panel with speed, but also the elusive TP Regen.                     |
| Will 'o' Wisp  |   1%   | The first legendary panel, bestowing tremendous magical offensive powers!     |
| Minitaur       |   5%   | Primarily a physical offensive panel, but grants a bonus to EXP gains.        |
| Wraith         |   8%   | A panel bearing high amounts of magic resistance and surprisibly, crit block. |
| !Spoop Maestro |   8%   | `an improved drop rate of the Wraith's panel`                                 |

##### Time-sensitive Side quest: Loot all four of the previous fallen adventurers from the `West Wing`
This side quest can be activated by interacting with any of the four fallen heroes. The goal of the side quest is
pretty simple: just interact with all four of the fallen heroes that are strewn across the various maps that make up
the first pass through the mines. For brevity, the four can be found in the following maps that will be walked through
below:
- `Mansion Entrance`: "The Generic Warrior" (`Javelin` and food)
- `Northwestern Depths`: "The Primary Mage" (`Dark Ball` and food)
- `Double Vision`: "The Slow and Heavy Hitter" (`Basic Arm` and food)
- `Downward Spiral`: "The Primary Healer" (`Old Tome` and food)

> If you choose not to do this before exiting the mines, you will not ever be able to get this loot again. There is
> nothing unique amidst this loot, just craftable weapons and an offhand, but why pass up free loot?

#### Map: Mansions Entrance
You land here after escaping the West Wing in `Raevula`. After a short discussion between `Rupert` and `Jerald`, you
will also be forced to notice your first accomplishable side quest described above. You can choose not to interact with
them if you prefer, but it is free loot, so it is encouraged.

By interacting with all four, the quest will be completed. 

done with mines around level 11-14.

### <a name="step5" /> Step 5: First Stroll Through the Forest of Dreams

A dungeon immediately after a dungeon isn't easy, but at this point, your goal is to explore the depths of `The Forest
of Dreams`. "The depths of the forest" defined as trying to head not-north. Heading north in general will eventually
lead you back to `Raevula` where you can restock, hit up Viktor for some smithing, or otherwise.

| name               | drop % | description                                                                          |
|--------------------|:------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fungrowth          |   5%   | Purely offensive, adding both Power and Force at the cost of item effectiveness.     |
| Jelly              |   1%   | Magi-centric with all of Max MP, Magi Cost, and MP Regen among other things.         |
| Dryad              |   5%   | Offensive panel with high Force gains, but also increases Aggro.                     |
| !Queen of Stone    |  50%   | `an improved drop rate of the Dryad's panel`                                         |
| Bandit             |   8%   | A very fast panel with a bit of luck and Crit Dodge.                                 |
| Gluttonwolf (Boss) |  `--`  | `This enemy does not drop a panel.`                                                  |
| Gluttonwolf        |   1%   | Extremely rare, but bears a lot of supporting stats, including TP Regen and Crit Amp.|



done with forest at around level 18-20.

### <a name="step6" /> Step 6: First Dive Into the Forlorn Basin

The `Forlorn Basin` is another dungeon-within-a-dungeon. To reach there, just go directly south 2 maps from `Millie`
the "Nature Lover", and there will be a cave that previously was unexplorable due to the path being blocked by `The
Alchemist`, but he is notably missing, granting entry to the dungeon.

| name           | drop % | description                                                                       |
|----------------|:------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crawler        |   4%   | A rare panel that trades Power for improved Hit and resistance to Environ Damage. |
| Goobat         |  10%   | An unusual panel that reduces speed, but improves HP/TP regen and healing rate.   |
| Will 'o' Wisp  |   1%   | The first legendary panel, bestowing tremendous magical offensive powers!         |
| !Blister       |  50%   | `an improved drop rate of the Will 'o' Wisp's panel`                              |
| Stonefur       |   4%   | A physically defensive panel that also gives a buff to ones healing rate.         |
| Pudding (Boss) |  `--`  | `This enemy does not drop a panel.`                                               |
