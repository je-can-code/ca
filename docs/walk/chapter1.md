# Chapter 1

## Overview
Chapter 1 is the main introductory chapter. It'll cover all the way up through an introduction to the hub city of the
game, Raevula. At this point, it isn't really made clear that the town is the "hub city" of the game, but that will be
gradually introduced as the player is continually returned to the city.

### <a name="step1" /> Step 1: Learning from the Lair of Erocian Death

The game opens after selecting `New Game!` from the title screen, by dropping the player abruptly inside the entrance
to `Lair of Erocian Death`. This is a highly over-dramatized name for the intro dungeon, but the goal of this dungeon
is to introduce the player to the basic controls.

As such, the player will be forced to navigate forward through the cave to continue the story.

> NOTE: the "Ghosty" and "Gilbert Von Ghosty" both drop the same Node.
> 
```
[Node Data]
Ghosty:                 30% drop; grants general offensive stats at the cost of 
!Gilbert Von Ghosty:    50% drop; 
```

#### Room 1: Where you start
Nothing special happens here. It just opens and informs the player that they should proceed. The player should also be
blocked from exiting the cave at this point.

#### Room 2: How to attack
The player is introduced to the ever-infamous enemy: `The Ghosty`. The purpose for being introduced to this enemy is to
learn what the attack button is. The player doesn't actually have to defeat `The Ghosty` to proceed, but it only takes
one full combo to obliterate, so it is projected the player will defeat it.

#### Room 3: How to use combat skills
Here there is a couple of things the player is introduced to. The first and most important are combat skills. The
second is **Named Enemies**. 

> **Named Enemies** are unique enemies that typically only appear in a specific location under certain circumstances.

#### Room 4: How to guard
The player will see that there are auto-firing fireballs all around. While they are probably easy enough to dodge,
`Rupert` uses this opportunity to remind `Jerald` that _he has a weakness to fire_ ðŸ”¥, and that he should actually try
to guard or parry the fireballs instead. Sure, it doesn't make sense, but it works!

#### Room 5: What is a Trap Room
This room is distinctly shaped with a number of `Ghosty` enemies around the room. Upon entering, the player will be
alerted that the room is locked and that they must defeat the enemies! That is all. Just chop up all visible enemies to
proceed. There should be 8 of them, with no restriction on how to defeat them.

> The concept of a `Trap Room` will be re-used repeatedly throughout this game.

#### Room 6: How to use ranged attacks
In this room, the player will automatically be party cycled to `Rupert` and dropped into yet another `Trap Room` with
some `Ghosty` enemies that are out of reach of `Jerald`'s attacks. It is encouraged to use `Rupert`'s basic attack or
his **Fireball** spell to take down the enemies across the gap.

At this point, `Rupert`'s basic attack is a three-way shot that costs a significant amount of his MP. While `Jerald`'s
offhand skill is actually the ability to guard/parry thanks to his starting equipment, `Rupert`'s offhand skill is not
to parry, but instead use `Rejuvenate`, a "Liquid"-elemental spell that heals the user's MP both upfront and over time.
If you should run out of MP, you can just wait for it to naturally recover, or use this skill.

#### Room 7: Down and Around
This section of the cave is purely exploratory. Going down the rope should be automatic after a point, and then just
navigate back up towards the front of the map where the bubbles were. Interacting with the bubbles brings you to the
next map- your first boss!

#### Room 8: The Erocian Slime Boss
This is the player's first boss battle, as indicated by the "boss gauge" showing up at the top. The `Erocian Slime` is
is basically just a normal enemy that has a bit more health than the other enemies. After chopping or burning it up,
the player is prompted to climb the newly spawned vines, which lead the player back to "Room 1"!

The player is now offered a save panel, and able to exit the cave.

### <a name="step2" /> Step 2: Going to ~~the store~~ Raevula

After a rugged tutorial like that, it is nice to see greenery, right? Well get used to it, because many maps in this
game utilize this same tileset, so you'll be seeing it a lot!

The journey to Raevula is a relatively small one. A hop skip and a jump through a few maps chopping up mobs and you'll
well be on your way to the "hub city"!

> TIP: It is highly recommended to farm for Nodes and Node points here! Since you will only have 2 given to you from
>   the story, it is almost required that the player farm Nodes to some extent.

> TODO: move the below "note" to the documentation for the SDP system.

> NOTE ABOUT NODES: In case it was not clear, "Nodes" are the fancy name I gave to "SDPs" aka
>   "Stat Distribution Panels". In this game, almost every distinct enemy in the game will drop a single Node that then
>   can be leveled up using the "Node points" that is also earned by defeating enemies. It is not uncommon that
>   mastering a Node results in additional effects, usually learning a new skill. Thus, it is STRONGLY encouraged that
>   the player keep ontop of this. Understandably, later down the road, the player may start to lose track of what was
>   earned and what was not from enemies, and they will gain access to the "Omnipedia" which has a bestiary in it that
>   also tracks which enemies have in fact dropped their Nodes.

```
[Node Data]
Needler:    8% drop; grants mobility skill upon mastery.
Wolftrap:   5% drop; lots of max MP from leveling.
Bearcat:    5% drop; lots of HP regen and physical attack from leveling.
Kappa:      2% drop; FORTUNE (not many panels raise this parameter) from leveling.
```

#### Map 1: Adventurer's Road
This is the first map including proper greenery, and thus including a much more upbeat BGM (thanks to Ys9)! Here, the
player _can_ (skippable) learn about `party cycling`, `accessing the quick menu`, and is promptly introduced to the
first humanoid that isn't in your party: `???`, where the player can learn about the "Node System" (aka my SDP system).

#### Map 2: Riverside Stroll
Aptly named for its massive body of water that the player will travel beside while navigating the map. Here the player
will be introduced to the concept of saving (as in, explained that it should happen, despite the fact that a save point
did appear in the intro cave after defeating the boss).

Additionally, there is an entrance to the `Pearl Salt Mines` (aka "the mines") here, but the enemies are likely to be
much stronger than the player at this point, and it is strongly recommended to NOT enter here. Even if you could enter
here, without the `Snakerope`, there is little to explore... but there are enemies to chop up.

Lastly, there is a cracked wall susceptible to bombing here, but without `Bombs` and a `Snakerope`, there is still not
really much that the player can do here.

> TODO: move the save tutorial over to the intro cave.

#### Map 3: Up and Down

> TODO: keep going.
