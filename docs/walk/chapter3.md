### Overview
Chapter 3 is the conclusion of the introduction to the gameplay loop. Before one can achieve such mastery, one will
have to navigate the erocian isthmus, traverse a volcanic grotto, hop skip jump through the waterway, explore a dusty
old castle, and climb one cold ass mountain. The player will acquire the rest of the primary tools in this chapter, and
also unlock the rest of the primary party the player will have in this game.
