### Overview

first dive into the basin, a tightrope walk by the cliffs, a beautiful lakeside view of a mysterious castle, and a

### <a name="step1" /> Step 1: First Dive Into the Forlorn Basin

The `Forlorn Basin` is another dungeon-within-a-dungeon. To reach there, just go directly south 2 maps from `Millie`
the "Nature Lover", and there will be a cave that previously was unexplorable due to the path being blocked by `The
Alchemist`, but he is notably missing, granting entry to the dungeon.
