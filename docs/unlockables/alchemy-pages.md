# Alchemy Pages

This effort is unlocked as a part of the quest "side-009" aka "The Journal of Alchemy". Each objective of the quest
will suggest the player reach some vaguely-described location where a page of the journal may be. After completing
each objective, the player can return to the alchemist to exchange the page for more formulai.

The location of the pages are below.

## First page, The Great Bird

The first page is in the possession of a giant named bird monster- an alternative Garuda- on the Negative Peaks. The
named bird only shows up for four hours in the early morning (4a-8a game time). Defeating it will give the player access
to its nest and in turn the first page.

## Second page, The Watery View

The second page is available for the player by simply reaching the southeastern elevated section of the map in the
Lakeside Road field. This requires the snakerope to reach.

## Third page, The Warm Spot

The third page is available on the Northern Way of the Highwater Way field. This requires the snakerope to reach, but
the player should have that by the time this map is accessible.

## Fourth Page, The Hunting Spot

The fourth page is found in the Forest of Dreams dungeon, in the western-most section at the top of the multiple
cliff-jumping map.

## Fifth Page, The Toothpicks (???)

The fifth page is located on the north eastern part of the Terraced Cliffside map, within the Outer Cliffs field. The
player has to jump down from the top area to reach the cliff that has the page on it.
