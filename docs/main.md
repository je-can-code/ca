The game of Chef Adventure is one of Jerald and Rupert's many pangalactic adventures around the universe. This
adventure is created using RPG Maker MZ and a multitude of my own hand-written plugins to enable on-the-map
hack-n-slash & grindy & loot-and-crafty & laughable-story RPG ⚔️👾🔥📊!

> **It is probably needless to say, but many of the below links will contain various kinds of spoilers for this game!**

As such, while the plugins living in my [other repository can be found over here][1], this documentation will include:
- [a high-level game walkthrough accompanied by general area details][10]
- [some additional area detail, separate from the actual story walk through][11]
- [some weapon type information][12]
- [some enemy family information][13]
- [some SDP information][14]

And of course, a list of unlockables and their details:
- [Flux Drive locations][15]
- [Recipe Journal locations][16]
- [Blueprint Scrap locations][17]
- [Elemental ally locations][18]
- [Alchemy Page locations][18]
