The game of Chef Adventure is one of Jerald and Rupert's many pangalactic adventures around the universe. This
adventure is created using RPG Maker MZ and a multitude of my own hand-written plugins to enable on-the-map
hack-n-slash & grindy & loot-and-crafty & laughable-story RPG ⚔️👾🔥📊!

As such, while the plugins living in my [other repository can be found over here][1], this documentation will include:
- [a high-level game walkthrough accompanied by general area details][10]
- some additional area detail, separate from the actual story walk through
- some weapon type information
- some enemy family information
- [some SDP information][14]
- a list of unlockables and their info
  - Flux Drive locations
  - Recipe Journal locations
  - Blueprint Scrap enemies
  - Elemental ally locations
  - Alchemy Page enemies
