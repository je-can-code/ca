## Scientist

## Location
### Day
Raevula, the Comfy Bear Inn, upstairs in the Comfy Embrace during the day- and later her lab.

### Night
Raevula, the Red Baron Pub, at the bar during the night.

## About
The scientist, introduced as Treis, apparently crashlanded onto this planet while on some sort of space exploration
mission. Her crew all died on landing, while somehow she survived unphased. She is a bossy sort of individual. She will
tell the player and team where to go and what to do for the first few chapters of the story, but later ends up just
accepting her fate and wanting to study the planet she crashlanded on.

In addition to being a scientist, she is also an inventor and creates tools for the player as the main story progresses
and more are needed, such as bombs.

## Quests

### 0) Unlock Quest: `main-007`
While Treis is not the questgiver of this quest, nor really involved in it a whole lot, she is busy hanging outside of
the kingdom while the player spelunks about the ruins and provides healing and bombs should you need respite. After the
quest is completed, she will finally become available for taking personal quests back in the Comfy Bear Inn of Raevula.

### 1) A Foundation: `???`
Since Treis is still rather stuck on the planet while the player and team fuck around with whatever they are doing, she
wants a place to study. In order to do that, you'll need to fetch some foundational minerals for building a new house
where that nature lover used to reside.

#### After effects of "A Foundation"
There are different kinds of ore that can be used to fulfill this quest, and depending on the choice will determine the
look of the ground that will get laid out for her new lab.

### 2) Structural Integrity: `???`
While it isn't clear how bringing a pile of ore allowed Treis to magically lay out foundation, she is now demanding you
fetch her some lumber. It can only be assumed that her next goal is to actually construct a building with it.

#### After effects of "Structural Integrity"
There are different kinds of lumber that can be used to fulfill this quest, and depending on the choice will determine
the look of the building itself that will define the lab. Additionally, the building will be accessible to the player.

### 3) A Technical Suite: `???`
Sure enough, as if overnight, the building was built! Her next ask is to have the player bring her some ores and other
crafting materials to rebuild her toolset. Logically one would assume she is having the smith or someone do this for
her, but... knowing her, it is better not to ask.

#### After effects of "A Technical Suite"
While there is no variance in the tools being built, by building these tools the player will have access to Treis'
"invent" functionality- another aspect of JAFTING. Additionally, all future quests for Treis will be taken from the lab
where she now apparently lives instead of the Comfy Bear Inn.
