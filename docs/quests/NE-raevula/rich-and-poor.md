# Rich & Poor (relatively)

## Location
Raevula, just outside of the Comfy Bear Inn.

## About
The rich man's name is Vanderslop, while the average man's name is Peter. Vanderslop is obviously haughty taughty and a
huge fucking jerk, while Peter is... extremely average and normal.

Vanderslop's fiancee is Iris, the calculating heroine perusing the goods of The Withered Thorn. She actually hates
Vanderslop, but agreed to the engagement due to reasons, but pines for Peter for all his stable normalcy. He is the son
of Wyatt the Mayor of Raevula and flaunts his wealth in the faces of everyone he has the opportunity to.

Peter is the epitome of normalcy, who happens to be the farmer that manages the crops Millie. He is rather passionate,
but constantly badgered by Vanderslop who believes he is nothing but a worthless peasant who should obey him due to his
lineage of being the mayor's son. Peter has a penchant for potatoes.

## Quests

### About progression through this quest chain
Vanderslop perceives Peter as a rival/inferior, and as a result, with every quest completed his rantings and ravings
towards Peter will escalate further and further. 

### 0) Unlock Quest: `main-003`
Upon Jerald and Rupert's return after slaying Wyatt in the Forest of Dreams, the protagonists hear the two arguing
especially loudly; Vanderslop is fed up with Peter's insolence and so the quest chain is unlocked.

### 1a) Tribute: `???`
Vanderslop is absolutely livid with Peter's ignorance of his wealth. As a result, he demands tribute in the form of
delicious food. Specifically, he demands a salad. Of course, Peter being a farmer, he has some materials, but what kind
of salad can even be served to a fuckwad like Vanderslop? The `Wilted Wolftrap Salad`, naturally. Three of them.

### 1b) Helping Hand: `???`
With Vanderslop appeased for now, Peter recognizes your adventurer-like helpfulness, and has a humble request: his
tunic that he wears when farming is totally now a `Dilapidated Tunic`, having lost its `Verte` shimmer. Please take his
tunic and replenish its lost gloss and return with a `Verte Tunic` so he can farm in the harsh elements of Erocia once
again safely.

### 2a) Panegyric: `???`
Vanderslop is raging once again, unable to comprehend how Peter is not disappointed with himself for not being as
wealthy as Vanderslop. He laments "if you're truly happy, then prove it by showing me the fruits of your labor".
Despite the clearly flawed logic in Vanderslop's statements, it is up to Peter to yield the "fruits of his labor".
He is a farmer though, and while he can provide you the produce to make it, it seems it is up to you to cook another
dish for Vanderslop: specifically the `Seeing Jambalaya`. Again, three of them.

### 2b) Friend in Need: `???`
With Vanderslop sated once more, Peter can return to the original reason for which he came to Raevula in the first
place: to get some replacement shoes. Working long hours on the farm have resulted in wearing his soles to the bone.
His ask is simple: just some `Regular Shoes`- though coincidentally those are tier-5 shoes...
