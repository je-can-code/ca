# Innkeeper

## Location
Raevula, in the Comfy Bear Inn, behind the main counter.

## About
The innkeeper, later introduced as Yelena, manages the Comfy Bear Inn in the hub town of Raevula. Her personality type
lends her to drooling over apparently(tbd?) Very Muscular Men™. She is overall a very friendly person, albeit a bit
nonchalant about her requests potentially resulting in the player's demise.

## Quests

### 0) Unlock Quest: `main-002`
The first quest is a part of the main story. The player will come to the inn in search of a place to cook the newfound
erocian slime so they can make the dish they desire, but before they are allowed to use her kitchen, she demands they
go chop up some bearcats outside of Raevula.

### 1) More Terror: `???`
It turns out that the bearcats are at it again, and rather than thinning their population with further genocide, she
considers alternative options. Apparently, there are fiercer and more menacing bearcat-like monsters- the "Stonefurs".
They are the progenitors of the bearcats that terrorize the citizens of Raevula. She insists that the player should go
chop some of these up so she can string up their hides around the gates of Raevula to ward off the bearcat rabble.

#### After effects of "More Terror"
As a result of completing this quest, some sort of visual indicator of "hides being strung up around the gates" should
appear around Raevula.

### 2) Bearcat Viscera: `???`
Yelena is thoroughly impressed by the player's prowess at eliminating such monsters and wants to see it in the flesh!
The player thinks about it, and determines there is a spot way out in Fallen Kingdom where there were only a couple of
the "Grimfangs" where the innkeeper could probably safely watch. So the player invites her to make her way to that
designated location and observe the bloodbath that is the player and team genociding these voidal bearcats to satisfy
the innkeepers obscure hunger for 3rd party bloodlust.
